	abstract = {Membraneless compartments, such as complex coacervates, have been hypothesized as plausible prebiotic micro-compartments due to their ability to sequester {RNA}; however, their compatibility with essential {RNA} World chemistries is unclear. We show that such compartments can enhance key prebiotically-relevant {RNA} chemistries. We demonstrate that template-directed {RNA} polymerization is sensitive to polycation identity, with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride ({PDAC}) outperforming poly(allylamine), poly(lysine), and poly(arginine) in polycation/{RNA} coacervates. Differences in {RNA} diffusion rates between {PDAC}/{RNA} and oligoarginine/{RNA} coacervates imply distinct biophysical environments. Template-directed {RNA} polymerization is relatively insensitive to Mg2+ concentration when performed in {PDAC}/{RNA} coacervates as compared to buffer, even enabling partial rescue of the reaction in the absence of magnesium. Finally, we show enhanced activities of multiple nucleic acid enzymes including two ribozymes and a deoxyribozyme, underscoring the generality of this approach, in which functional nucleic acids like aptamers and ribozymes, and in some cases key cosolutes localize within the coacervate microenvironments., Membraneless compartments have been theorized to be prebiotic micro-compartments as they spontaneously encapsulate {RNA} and proteins. Here, the authors report membraneless compartments can enhance {RNA} chemistries, affecting template directed {RNA} polymerization and stimulating nucleic acid enzymes.},

	abstract = {Group I Intron Sequence and Structure Database ({GISSD}) is a specialized and comprehensive database for group I introns, focusing on the integration of useful group I intron information from available databases and providing de novo data that is essential for understanding these introns at a systematic level. This database presents 1789 complete intron records, including the nucleotide sequence of each annotated intron plus 15 nt of the upstream and downstream exons, and the pseudoknots-containing secondary structures predicted by integrating comparative sequence analyses and minimal free energy algorithms. These introns represent all 14 subgroups, with their structure-based alignments being separately provided. Both structure predictions and alignments were done manually and iteratively adjusted, which yielded a reliable consensus structure for each subgroup. These consensus structures allowed us to judge the confidence of 20 085 group I introns previously found by the {INFERNAL} program and to classify them into subgroups automatically. The database provides intron-associated taxonomy information from {GenBank}, allowing one to view the detailed distribution of all group I introns. {CDSs} residing in introns and 3D structure information are also integrated if available. About 17 000 group I introns have been validated in this database; ∼95\% of them belong to the {IC}3 subgroup and reside in the chloroplast {tRNALeu} gene.

	abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis ({DCA}). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of {DCA}, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by {DCA} for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. {DCA} is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by {DCA} can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

The synthetic proteins adopt the characteristic {WW} structure and recognize typical {WW} target sequences. Since the information used in designing these proteins was obtained from multiple sequence alignments only, with no prior knowledge of three-dimensional structure, it is clear that for some proteins, a relatively small quantity of sequence information is sufficient to specify the complex amino acid interactions that make up a functional protein.},

Frequencies of structures are highly non-uniform and follow a generalized form of Zipf’s law: we find relatively few common and many rare ones. By using an algorithm for inverse folding, we show that sequences sharing the same structure are distributed randomly over sequence space. All common structures can be accessed from an arbitrary sequence by a number of mutations much smaller than the chain length. The sequence space is percolated by extensive neutral networks connecting nearest neighbours folding into identical structures. Implications for evolutionary adaptation and for applied molecular evolution are evident: finding a particular structure by mutation and selection is much simpler than expected and, even if catalytic activity should turn out to be sparse in the space of {RNA} structures, it can hardly be missed by evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {This paper is the first part of a trilogy, which comprises a detailed study of a special type of functional organization and demonstrates its relevance with respect to the origin and evolution of life. Self-replicative macromolecules, such as {RNA} or {DNA} in a suitable environment exhibit a behavior, which we may call Darwinian and which can be formally represented by the concept of the quasi-species. A quasi-species is defined as a given distribution of macromolecular species with closely interrelated sequences, dominated by one or several (degenerate) master copies. External constraints enforce the selection of the best adapted distribution, commonly referred to as the wild-type. Most important for Darwinian behavior are the criteria for internal stability of the quasi-species. If these criteria are violated, the information stored in the nucleotide sequence of the master copy will disintegrate irreversibly leading to an error catastrophy. As a consequence, selection and evolution of {RNA} or {DNA} molecules is limited with respect to the amount of information that can be stored in a single replicative unit. An analysis of experimental data regarding {RNA} and {DNA} replication at various levels of organization reveals, that a sufficient amount of information for the build up of a translation machinery can be gained only via integration of several different replicative units (or reproductive cycles) through functional linkages. A stable functional integration then will raise the system to a new level of organization and thereby enlarge its information capacity considerably. The hypercycle appears to be such a form of organization.},

Hypercyclic organization offers selective stabilization and evolutive adaptation for all geno- and phenotypic constituents of the functionally linked ensemble. It originates in a molecular quasi-species and evolves by way of mutation and gene duplication to greater complexity. Its early structure appears to be reflected in: the assignment of codons to amino acids, in sequence homologies of {tRNAs}, in dual enzymic functions of replication and translation, and in the structural and functional organization of the genome of the prokaryotic cell.},

	abstract = {The error threshold for replication, the critical copying fidelity below which the fittest genotype deterministically disappears, limits the length of the genome that can be maintained by selection. Primordial replication must have been error-prone, and so early replicators are thought to have been necessarily short1. The error threshold also depends on the fitness landscape. In an {RNA} world2, many neutral and compensatory mutations can raise the threshold, below which the functional phenotype3, rather than a particular sequence, is still present4,5. Here we show, on the basis of comparative analysis of two extensively mutagenized ribozymes, that with a copying fidelity of 0.999 per digit per replication the phenotypic error threshold rises well above 7,000 nucleotides, which permits the selective maintenance of a functionally rich riboorganism6 with a genome of more than 100 different genes, the size of a {tRNA}. This requires an order of magnitude of improvement in the accuracy of in vitro–generated polymerase ribozymes7,8. Incidentally, this genome size coincides with that estimated for a minimal cell achieved by top-down analysis9, omitting the genes dealing with translation.},

	abstract = {Mutually catalytic sets of simple organic molecules have been suggested to be capable of self-replication and rudimentary chemical evolution. Previous models for the behavior of such sets have analyzed the global properties of short biopolymer ensembles by using graph theory and a mean field approach. In parallel, experimental studies with the autocatalytic formation of amphiphilic assemblies (e.g., lipid vesicles or micelles) demonstrated self-replication properties resembling those of living cells. Combining these approaches, we analyze here the kinetic behavior of small heterogeneous assemblies of spontaneously aggregating molecules, of the type that could form readily under prebiotic conditions. A statistical formalism for mutual rate enhancement is used to numerically simulate the detailed chemical kinetics within such assemblies. We demonstrate that a straightforward set of assumptions about kinetically enhanced recruitment of simple amphiphilic molecules, as well as about the spontaneous growth and splitting of assemblies, results in a complex population behavior. The assemblies manifest a significant degree of homeostasis, resembling the previously predicted quasi-stationary states of biopolymer ensembles (Dyson, F. J. (1982) J. Mol. Evol. 18, 344–350). Such emergent catalysis-driven, compositionally biased entities may be viewed as having rudimentary “compositional genomes.” Our analysis addresses the question of how mutually catalytic metabolic networks, devoid of sequence-based biopolymers, could exhibit transfer of chemical information and might undergo selection and evolution. This computed behavior may constitute a demonstration of natural selection in populations of molecules without genetic apparatus, suggesting a pathway from random molecular assemblies to a minimal protocell.},

	abstract = {A basic property of life is its capacity to experience Darwinian evolution. The replicator concept is at the core of genetics-first theories of the origin of life, which suggest that self-replicating oligonucleotides or their similar ancestors may have been the first "living" systems and may have led to the evolution of an {RNA} world. But problems with the nonenzymatic synthesis of biopolymers and the origin of template replication have spurred the alternative metabolism-first scenario, where self-reproducing and evolving proto-metabolic networks are assumed to have predated self-replicating genes. Recent theoretical work shows that "compositional genomes" (i.e., the counts of different molecular species in an assembly) are able to propagate compositional information and can provide a setup on which natural selection acts. Accordingly, if we stick to the notion of replicator as an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications, those macromolecular aggregates could be dubbed "ensemble replicators" (composomes) and quite different from the more familiar genes and memes. In sharp contrast with template-dependent replication dynamics, we demonstrate here that replication of compositional information is so inaccurate that fitter compositional genomes cannot be maintained by selection and, therefore, the system lacks evolvability (i.e., it cannot substantially depart from the asymptotic steady-state solution already built-in in the dynamical equations). We conclude that this fundamental limitation of ensemble replicators cautions against metabolism-first theories of the origin of life, although ancient metabolic systems could have provided a stable habitat within which polymer replicators later evolved.},

	abstract = {Life is that which replicates and evolves, but there is no consensus on how life emerged. We advocate a systems protobiology view, whereby the first replicators were assemblies of spontaneously accreting, heterogeneous and mostly non-canonical amphiphiles. This view is substantiated by rigorous chemical kinetics simulations of the graded autocatalysis replication domain ({GARD}) model, based on the notion that the replication or reproduction of compositional information predated that of sequence information. {GARD} reveals the emergence of privileged non-equilibrium assemblies (composomes), which portray catalysis-based homeostatic (concentration-preserving) growth. Such a process, along with occasional assembly fission, embodies cell-like reproduction. {GARD} pre-{RNA} evolution is evidenced in the selection of different composomes within a sparse fitness landscape, in response to environmental chemical changes. These observations refute claims that {GARD} assemblies (or other mutually catalytic networks in the metabolism first scenario) cannot evolve. Composomes represent both a genotype and a selectable phenotype, anteceding present-day biology in which the two are mostly separated. Detailed {GARD} analyses show attractor-like transitions from random assemblies to self-organized composomes, with negative entropy change, thus establishing composomes as dissipative systems—hallmarks of life. We show a preliminary new version of our model, metabolic {GARD} (M-{GARD}), in which lipid covalent modifications are orchestrated by non-enzymatic lipid catalysts, themselves compositionally reproduced. M-{GARD} fills the gap of the lack of true metabolism in basic {GARD}, and is rewardingly supported by a published experimental instance of a lipid-based mutually catalytic network. Anticipating near-future far-reaching progress of molecular dynamics, M-{GARD} is slated to quantitatively depict elaborate protocells, with orchestrated reproduction of both lipid bilayer and lumenal content. Finally, a {GARD} analysis in a whole-planet context offers the potential for estimating the probability of life's emergence. The invigorated {GARD} scrutiny presented in this review enhances the validity of autocatalytic sets as a bona fide early evolution scenario and provides essential infrastructure for a paradigm shift towards a systems protobiology view of life's origin.},

	abstract = {Large molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids are crucial for life, yet their primordial origin remains a major puzzle. The production of large molecules, as we know it today, requires good catalysts, and the only good catalysts we know that can accomplish this task consist of large molecules. Thus the origin of large molecules is a chicken and egg problem in chemistry. Here we present a mechanism, based on autocatalytic sets ({ACSs}), that is a possible solution to this problem. We discuss a mathematical model describing the population dynamics of molecules in a stylized but prebiotically plausible chemistry. Large molecules can be produced in this chemistry by the coalescing of smaller ones, with the smallest molecules, the ‘food set’, being buffered. Some of the reactions can be catalyzed by molecules within the chemistry with varying catalytic strengths. Normally the concentrations of large molecules in such a scenario are very small, diminishing exponentially with their size. {ACSs}, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the resources of the system into a sparse set of molecules. {ACSs} can produce a bistability in the population dynamics and, in particular, steady states wherein the {ACS} molecules dominate the population. However to reach these steady states from initial conditions that contain only the food set typically requires very large catalytic strengths, growing exponentially with the size of the catalyst molecule. We present a solution to this problem by studying ‘nested {ACSs}’, a structure in which a small {ACS} is connected to a larger one and reinforces it. We show that when the network contains a cascade of nested {ACSs} with the catalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with their size (e.g., as a power law), a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules can come to dominate the system.},

Improving our ability to construct and functionally characterize {DNA} sequences would broadly accelerate progress in biology. Here, we introduce {DropSynth}, a scalable, low-cost method to build thousands of defined gene-length constructs in a pooled (multiplexed) manner. {DropSynth} uses a library of barcoded beads that pull down the oligonucleotides necessary for a gene’s assembly, which are then processed and assembled in water-in-oil emulsions. We used {DropSynth} to successfully build more than 7000 synthetic genes that encode phylogenetically diverse homologs of two essential genes in Escherichia coli. We tested the ability of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase homologs to complement a knockout E. coli strain in multiplex, revealing core functional motifs and reasons underlying homolog incompatibility. {DropSynth} coupled with multiplexed functional assays allows us to rationally explore sequence-function relationships at an unprecedented scale.

Capacitance has important implications for the evolution of novel forms and functions, but experimentally studied mechanisms behind capacitance are mostly limited to complex, multicomponent systems often involving several interacting protein molecules. Here we demonstrate phenotypic capacitance within a much simpler system, an individual {RNA} molecule with catalytic activity (ribozyme). This naturally occurring {RNA} molecule has a modular structure, where a scaffold module acts as an intramolecular chaperone that facilitates folding of a second catalytic module. Previous studies have shown that the scaffold module is not absolutely required for activity, but dramatically decreases the concentration of magnesium ions required for the formation of an active site. Here, we use an experimental perturbation of magnesium ion concentration that disrupts the folding of certain genetic variants of this ribozyme and use in vitro selection followed by deep sequencing to identify genotypes with altered phenotypes (catalytic activity). We identify multiple conditional mutations that alter the wild-type ribozyme phenotype under a stressful environmental condition of low magnesium ion concentration, but preserve the phenotype under more relaxed conditions. This conditional buffering is confined to the scaffold module, but controls the catalytic phenotype, demonstrating how modularity can enable phenotypic capacitance within a single macromolecule. {RNA}’s ancient role in life suggests that phenotypic capacitance may have influenced evolution since life’s origins.},

To understand how {RNA} libraries can evolve from randomness toward highly active catalysts, we analyze the original samples that led to the discovery of Diels-Alderase ribozymes by next-generation sequencing. Known structure-activity relationships are used to correlate abundance with catalytic performance. We find that efficient catalysts arose not just from selection for reactivity among the members of the starting library, but from improvement of less potent precursors by mutations. We observe changes in the ribozyme population in response to increasing selection pressure. Surprisingly, even after many rounds of enrichment, the libraries are highly diverse, suggesting that potential catalysts are more abundant in random space than generally thought. To highlight the use of next-generation sequencing as a tool for in vitro selections, we also apply this technique to a recent, less characterized ribozyme selection. Making use of the correlation between sequence evolution and catalytic activity, we predict mutations that improve ribozyme activity and validate them biochemically. Our study reveals principles underlying ribozyme in vitro selections and provides guidelines to render future selections more efficient, as well as to predict the conservation of key structural elements, allowing the rational improvement of catalysts.},

	abstract = {In the realm of nucleic acid structures, secondary structure forms a conceptually important intermediate level of description and explains the dominating part of the free energy of structure formation. Secondary structures are well conserved over evolutionary time-scales and for many classes of {RNAs} evolve slower than the underlying primary sequences. Given the close link between structure and function, secondary structure is routinely used as a basis to explain experimental findings. Recent technological advances, finally, have made it possible to assay secondary structure directly using high throughput methods. From a computational biology point of view, secondary structures have a special role because they can be computed efficiently using exact dynamic programming algorithms. In this contribution we provide a short overview of {RNA} folding algorithms, recent additions and variations and address methods to align, compare, and cluster {RNA} structures, followed by a tabular summary of the most important software suites in the fields.},

	abstract = {Tertiary structure prediction is important for understanding structure–function relationships for {RNAs} whose structures are unknown and for characterizing {RNA} states recalcitrant to direct analysis. However, it is unknown what root-mean-square deviation ({RMSD}) corresponds to a statistically significant {RNA} tertiary structure prediction. We use discrete molecular dynamics to generate {RNA}-like folds for structures up to 161 nucleotides (nt) that have complex tertiary interactions and then determine the {RMSD} distribution between these decoys. These distributions are Gaussian-like. The mean {RMSD} increases with {RNA} length and is smaller if secondary structure constraints are imposed while generating decoys. The compactness of {RNA} molecules with true tertiary folds is intermediate between closely packed spheres and a freely jointed chain. We use this scaling relationship to define an expression relating {RMSD} with the confidence that a structure prediction is better than that expected by chance. This is the prediction significance, and corresponds to a P-value. For a 100-nt {RNA}, the {RMSD} of predicted structures should be within 25 Å of the accepted structure to reach the P ≤ 0.01 level if the secondary structure is predicted de novo and within 14 Å if secondary structure information is used as a constraint. This significance approach should be useful for evaluating diverse {RNA} structure prediction and molecular modeling algorithms.},

Here, we present a new version of the {iFoldRNA} server that permits the prediction of tertiary structure of {RNAs} as long as a few hundred nucleotides.

	abstract = {{RNAs} must fold into unique three-dimensional structures to function in the cell, but how each polynucleotide finds its native structure is not understood. To investigate whether the stability of the tertiary structure determines the speed and accuracy of {RNA} folding, docking of a tetraloop with its receptor in a bacterial group I ribozyme was perturbed by site-directed mutagenesis. Disruption of the tetraloop or its receptor destabilizes tertiary interactions throughout the ribozyme by 2-3 kcal/mol, demonstrating that tertiary interactions form cooperatively in the transition from a native-like intermediate to the native state. Nondenaturing {PAGE} and {RNase} T1 digestion showed that base pairs form less homogeneously in the mutant {RNAs} during the transition from the unfolded state to the intermediate. Thus, tertiary interactions between helices bias the ensemble of secondary structures toward native-like conformations. Time-resolved hydroxyl radical footprinting showed that the wild type ribozyme folds completely within 5-20 ms. By contrast, only 40-60\% of a tetraloop mutant ribozyme folds in 30-40 ms, with the remainder folding in 30 – 200 s via non-native intermediates. Therefore, destabilization of tetraloop-receptor docking introduces an alternate folding pathway in the otherwise smooth energy landscape of the wild type ribozyme. Our results show that stable tertiary structure increases the flux through folding pathways that lead directly and rapidly to the native structure.},

The 5′-exon's 3′-{OH} is positioned for inline nucleophilic attack on the conformationally constrained scissile phosphate at the intron–3′-exon junction. Six phosphates from three disparate {RNA} strands converge to coordinate two metal ions that are asymmetrically positioned on opposing sides of the reactive phosphate.

	abstract = {The pace and unpredictability of evolution are critically relevant in a variety of modern challenges: combating drug resistance in pathogens and cancer, understanding how species respond to environmental perturbations like climate change, and developing artificial selection approaches for agriculture. Great progress has been made in quantitative modeling of evolution using fitness landscapes, allowing a degree of prediction for future evolutionary histories. Yet fine-grained control of the speed and the distributions of these trajectories remains elusive. We propose an approach to achieve this using ideas originally developed in a completely different context: counterdiabatic driving to control the behavior of quantum states for applications like quantum computing and manipulating ultra-cold atoms. Implementing these ideas for the first time in a biological context, we show how a set of external control parameters (i.e. varying drug concentrations / types, temperature, nutrients) can guide the probability distribution of genotypes in a population along a specified path and time interval. This level of control, allowing empirical optimization of evolutionary speed and trajectories, has myriad potential applications, from enhancing adaptive therapies for diseases, to the development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed evolution of biomolecules.},

	abstract = {Cooperation is a persistent behavioral pattern of entities pooling and sharing resources. Its ubiquity in nature poses a conundrum. Whenever two entities cooperate, one must willingly relinquish something of value to the other. Why is this apparent altruism favored in evolution? Classical solutions assume a net fitness gain in a cooperative transaction which, through reciprocity or relatedness, finds its way back from recipient to donor. We seek the source of this fitness gain. Our analysis rests on the insight that evolutionary processes are typically multiplicative and noisy. Fluctuations have a net negative effect on the long-time growth rate of resources but no effect on the growth rate of their expectation value. This is an example of non-ergodicity. By reducing the amplitude of fluctuations, pooling and sharing increases the long-time growth rate for cooperating entities, meaning that cooperators outgrow similar non-cooperators. We identify this increase in growth rate as the net fitness gain, consistent with the concept of geometric mean fitness in the biological literature. This constitutes a fundamental mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Its minimal assumptions make it a candidate explanation of cooperation in settings too simple for other fitness gains, such as emergent function and specialization, to be probable. One such example is the transition from single cells to early multicellular life.},

These include problems of invasive species propagation along boundaries of ecozones, problems of gene spread in such situations, morphogenesis in cavities, intracellular reaction etc. Piecewise linear approximations of reaction terms in reaction-diffusion systems often result in exact solutions of propagation front problems. This article presents an exact travelling solution for a reaction-diffusion system with a piecewise constant production restricted to a codimension-1 subset. The solution is monotone, propagates with the unique constant velocity, and connects the trivial solution to a nontrivial nonhomogeneous stationary solution of the problem.

	abstract = {A growing number of experimental evidence shows that it is general for a ligand binding protein to have a potential for allosteric regulation and for further evolution. In addition, such proteins generically change their conformation upon binding. O. Rivoire has recently proposed an evolutionary scenario that explains these properties as a generic byproduct of selection for exquisite discrimination between very similar ligands. The initial claim was supported by two classes of basic examples: continuous protein models with small numbers of degrees of freedom, on which the development of a conformational switch was established, and a 2-dimensional spin glass model supporting the rest of the statement. This work aimed to clarify the implication of the exquisite discrimination for smooth models with large number of degrees of freedom, the situation closer to real biological systems. With the help of differential geometry, jet-space analysis, and transversality theorems, it is shown that the claim holds true for any generic flexible system that can be described in terms of smooth manifolds. The result suggests that, indeed, evolutionary solutions to the exquisite discrimination problem, if exist, are located near a codimension-1 subspace of the appropriate genotypical space. This constraint, in turn, gives rise to a potential for the allosteric regulation of the discrimination via generic conformational changes upon binding.},

	abstract = {A recently reported crystal structure of an intact bacterial group I self-splicing intron in complex with both its exons provided the first molecular view into the mechanism of {RNA} splicing. This intron structure, which was trapped in the state prior to the exon ligation reaction, also reveals the architecture of a complex {RNA} fold. The majority of the intron is contained within three internally stacked, but sequence discontinuous, helical domains. Here the tertiary hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between the domains, and the single-stranded joiner segments that bridge between them, are fully described. Features of the structure include: (1) A pseudoknot belt that circumscribes the molecule at its longitudinal midpoint; (2) two tetraloop-tetraloop receptor motifs at the peripheral edges of the structure; (3) an extensive minor groove triplex between the paired and joiner segments, P6-J6/6a and P3-J3/4, which provides the major interaction interface between the intron’s two primary domains (P4-P6 and P3-P9.0); (4) a six-nucleotide J8/7 single stranded element that adopts a μ-shaped structure and twists through the active site, making critical contacts to all three helical domains; and (5) an extensive base stacking architecture that realizes 90\% of all possible stacking interactions. The intron structure was validated by hydroxyl radical footprinting, where strong correlation was observed between experimental and predicted solvent accessibility. Models of the pre-first and pre-second steps of intron splicing are proposed with full-sized {tRNA} exons. They suggest that the {tRNA} undergoes substantial angular motion relative to the intron between the two steps of splicing.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Realizing the value of synthetic biology in biotechnology and medicine requires the design of molecules with specialized functions. Due to its close structure to function relationship, and the availability of good structure prediction methods and energy models, {RNA} is perfectly suited to be synthetically engineered with predefined properties. However, currently available {RNA} design tools cannot be easily adapted to accommodate new design specifications. Furthermore, complicated sampling and optimization methods are often developed to suit a specific {RNA} design goal, adding to their inflexibility.
Results: We developed a C ++  library implementing a graph coloring approach to stochastically sample sequences compatible with structural and sequence constraints from the typically very large solution space. The approach allows to specify and explore the solution space in a well defined way. Our library also guarantees uniform sampling, which makes optimization runs performant by not only avoiding re-evaluation of already found solutions, but also by raising the probability of finding better solutions for long optimization runs. We show that our software can be combined with any other software package to allow diverse {RNA} design applications. Scripting interfaces allow the easy adaption of existing code to accommodate new scenarios, making the whole design process very flexible. We implemented example design approaches written in Python to demonstrate these advantages.

We exemplify the principles using the well-known theophylline aptamer throughout this work. The aptamer in its ligand-binding competent structure represents one structural conformation of the switch while an alternative fold that disrupts the binding-competent structure forms the other conformation. To keep it simple we do not incorporate any regulatory mechanism to control transcription or translation. We elucidate a commonly used design process by explicitly dissecting and explaining the necessary steps in detail. We developed a novel objective function which specifies the mechanistics of this simple, ligand-triggered riboswitch and describe an extensive in silico analysis pipeline to evaluate important kinetic properties of the designed sequences. This protocol and the developed software can be easily extended or adapted to fit novel design scenarios and thus can serve as a template for future needs.},

	abstract = {Motivations: The design of {RNA} sequences folding into predefined secondary structures is a milestone for many synthetic biology and gene therapy studies. Most of the current software uses similar local search strategies (i.e. a random seed is progressively adapted to acquire the desired folding properties) and more importantly do not allow the user to control explicitly the nucleotide distribution such as the {GC}-content in their sequences. However, the latter is an important criterion for large-scale applications as it could presumably be used to design sequences with better transcription rates and/or structural plasticity., Results: In this article, we introduce {IncaRNAtion}, a novel algorithm to design {RNA} sequences folding into target secondary structures with a predefined nucleotide distribution. {IncaRNAtion} uses a global sampling approach and weighted sampling techniques. We show that our approach is fast (i.e. running time comparable or better than local search methods), seedless (we remove the bias of the seed in local search heuristics) and successfully generates high-quality sequences (i.e. thermodynamically stable) for any {GC}-content. To complete this study, we develop a hybrid method combining our global sampling approach with local search strategies. Remarkably, our glocal methodology overcomes both local and global approaches for sampling sequences with a specific {GC}-content and target structure., Availability:

	doi = {10.1186/1748-7188-5-27},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {RNA} exhibits a variety of structural configurations. Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and G-U-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of {RNA} functionalities. In the context of studying natural {RNA} structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial {RNA}, it is of interest to find {RNA} sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, {RNAinverse}, {RNA}-{SSD} as well as {INFO}-{RNA} are limited to {RNA} secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm Inv which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures.
{RESULTS}: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm Inv. We give a detailed analysis of Inv, including pseudocodes. We show that Inv allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar {RNA} pseudoknot 3-noncrossing {RNA} structures-a class which is difficult to construct via dynamic programming routines. Inv is freely available at http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The algorithm Inv extends inverse folding capabilities to {RNA} pseudoknot structures. In comparison with {RNAinverse} it uses new ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result, Inv is not only able to find novel sequences even for {RNA} secondary structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially exhibit cross-serial interactions.},

	abstract = {Computational programs for predicting {RNA} sequences with desired folding properties have been extensively developed and expanded in the past several years. Given a secondary structure, these programs aim to predict sequences that fold into a target minimum free energy secondary structure, while considering various constraints. This procedure is called inverse {RNA} folding. Inverse {RNA} folding has been traditionally used to design optimized {RNAs} with favorable properties, an application that is expected to grow considerably in the future in light of advances in the expanding new fields of synthetic biology and {RNA} nanostructures. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that inverse {RNA} folding can successfully be used as a valuable preprocessing step in computational detection of novel noncoding {RNAs}. This review describes the most popular freeware programs that have been developed for such purposes, starting from {RNAinverse} that was devised when formulating the inverse {RNA} folding problem. The most recently published ones that consider {RNA} secondary structure as input are {antaRNA}, {RNAiFold} and {incaRNAfbinv}, each having different features that could be beneficial to specific biological problems in practice. The various programs also use distinct approaches, ranging from ant colony optimization to constraint programming, in addition to adaptive walk, simulated annealing and Boltzmann sampling. This review compares between the various programs and provides a simple description of the various possibilities that would benefit practitioners in selecting the most suitable program. It is geared for specific tasks requiring {RNA} design based on input secondary structure, with an outlook toward the future of {RNA} design programs.},

We prove the universality of this procedure with respect to ordinary first order differential equations in rational functions. In addition, we introduce a simple graphical procedure for calculating dynamical systems from petri nets in our formalism, which we use to recover several well-known dynamical systems. For proof-of-concept, we use our method to obtain a differential equation model for the {HES}1 gene transcription network that predicts post-intervention behaviours of the network.},

Utilizing secondary structure information aids in filtering out noisy solutions and achieves efficiency and robustness. Currently, only a few methods are available for addressing the multiple structural alignment task. In addition to using secondary structure information, the advantage of {MASS} as compared to these methods is that it is a combination of several important characteristics: (1) While most existing methods are based on series of pairwise comparisons, and thus might miss optimal global solutions, {MASS} is truly multiple, considering all the molecules simultaneously; (2) {MASS} is sequence order-independent and thus capable of detecting nontopological structural motifs; (3) {MASS} is able to detect not only structural motifs, shared by all input molecules, but also motifs shared only by subsets of the molecules. Here, we show the application of {MASS} to various protein ensembles. We demonstrate its ability to handle a large number (order of tens) of molecules, to detect nontopological motifs and to find biologically meaningful alignments within nonpredefined subsets of the input. In particular, we show how by using conserved structural motifs, one can guide protein–protein docking, which is a notoriously difficult problem. {MASS} is freely available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/{MASS}/.},

	abstract = {Computational design of {RNA} sequences that fold into targeted secondary structures has many applications in biomedicine, nanotechnology and synthetic biology. An {RNA} molecule is made of different types of secondary structure elements and an important {RNA} element named pseudoknot plays a key role in stabilizing the functional form of the molecule. However, due to the computational complexities associated with characterizing pseudoknotted {RNA} structures, most of the existing {RNA} sequence designer algorithms generally ignore this important structural element and therefore limit their applications. In this paper we present a new algorithm to design {RNA} sequences for pseudoknotted secondary structures. We use {NUPACK} as the folding algorithm to compute the equilibrium characteristics of the pseudoknotted {RNAs}, and describe a new adaptive defect weighted sampling algorithm named Enzymer to design low ensemble defect {RNA} sequences for targeted secondary structures including pseudoknots. We used a biological data set of 201 pseudoknotted structures from the Pseudobase library to benchmark the performance of our algorithm. We compared the quality characteristics of the {RNA} sequences we designed by Enzymer with the results obtained from the state of the art {MODENA} and {antaRNA}. Our results show our method succeeds more frequently than {MODENA} and {antaRNA} do, and generates sequences that have lower ensemble defect, lower probability defect and higher thermostability. Finally by using Enzymer and by constraining the design to a naturally occurring and highly conserved Hammerhead motif, we designed 8 sequences for a pseudoknotted cis-acting Hammerhead ribozyme. Enzymer is available for download at https://bitbucket.org/casraz/enzymer.},

	abstract = {Motivation {RNA} is a biopolymer with various applications inside the cell and in biotechnology. Structure of an {RNA} molecule mainly determines its function and is essential to guide nanostructure design. Since experimental structure determination is time-consuming and expensive, accurate computational prediction of {RNA} structure is of great importance. Prediction of {RNA} secondary structure is relatively simpler than its tertiary structure and provides information about its tertiary structure, therefore, {RNA} secondary structure prediction has received attention in the past decades. Numerous methods with different folding approaches have been developed for {RNA} secondary structure prediction. While methods for prediction of {RNA} pseudoknot-free structure (structures with no crossing base pairs) have greatly improved in terms of their accuracy, methods for prediction of {RNA} pseudoknotted secondary structure (structures with crossing base pairs) still have room for improvement. A long-standing question for improving the prediction accuracy of {RNA} pseudoknotted secondary structure is whether to focus on the prediction algorithm or the underlying energy model, as there is a trade-off on computational cost of the prediction algorithm versus the generality of the method. Results The aim of this work is to argue when comparing different methods for {RNA} pseudoknotted structure prediction, the combination of algorithm and energy model should be considered and a method should not be considered superior or inferior to others if they do not use the same scoring model. We demonstrate that while the folding approach is important in structure prediction, it is not the only important factor in prediction accuracy of a given method as the underlying energy model is also as of great value. Therefore we encourage researchers to pay particular attention in comparing methods with different energy models.},

	abstract = {Background
The analysis of sequence-structure relations of {RNA} is based on a specific notion and folding of {RNA} structure. The notion of coarse grained structure employed here is that of canonical {RNA} pseudoknot contact-structures with at most two mutually crossing bonds (3-noncrossing). These structures are folded by a novel, ab initio prediction algorithm, cross, capable of searching all 3-noncrossing {RNA} structures. The algorithm outputs the minimum free energy structure.

Results
After giving some background on {RNA} pseudoknot structures and providing an outline of the folding algorithm being employed, we present in this paper various, statistical results on the mapping from {RNA} sequences into 3-noncrossing {RNA} pseudoknot structures. We study properties, like the fraction of pseudoknot structures, the dominant pseudoknot-shapes, neutral walks, neutral neighbors and local connectivity. We then put our results into context of molecular evolution of {RNA}.

Conclusion
Our results imply that, in analogy to {RNA} secondary structures, 3-noncrossing pseudoknot {RNA} represents a molecular phenotype that is well suited for molecular and in particular neutral evolution. We can conclude that extended, percolating neutral networks of pseudoknot {RNA} exist.},

These cis-splicing ribozymes can be converted into trans-splicing ribozymes, which can modify the sequence of a separate substrate {RNA}, both in vitro and in vivo. Previous work on trans-splicing ribozymes has mostly focused on the 16S {rRNA} group I intron ribozyme from Tetrahymena thermophila. Here, we test the trans-splicing potential of the {tRNA}(Ile) group I intron ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus. This ribozyme is only half the size of the Tetrahymena ribozyme and folds faster into its active conformation in vitro. Our results showed that in vitro, the Azoarcus and Tetrahymena ribozymes favored the same set of splice sites on a substrate {RNA}. Both ribozymes showed the same trans-splicing efficiency when containing their individually optimized 5' terminus. In contrast to the previously optimized 5'-terminal design of the Tetrahymena ribozyme, the Azoarcus ribozyme was most efficient with a trans-splicing design that resembled the secondary structure context of the natural cis-splicing Azoarcus ribozyme, which includes base-pairing between the substrate 5' portion and the ribozyme 3' exon. These results suggested preferred trans-splicing interactions for the Azoarcus ribozyme under near-physiological in vitro conditions. Despite the high activity in vitro, however, the splicing efficiency of the Azoarcus ribozyme in Escherichia coli cells was significantly below that of the Tetrahymena ribozyme.},

	abstract = {Introducing artificial logic into biological control systems enables to reprogram the behavior of living cells with applications in synthetic biology, biotechnology and medicine. This requires to design artificial molecules with prescribed functionality. {RNA} is perfectly suited for this purpose due to its close structure to function relationship, its ability to sense environmental factors or to perform enzymatic reactions.
The current approach to design multi-state {RNA} molecules, e.g. riboswitches, thermoswitches or {sRNA} triggered devices, is a multi-step pipeline. It ideally comprises extensive analysis of the biological system, computational sampling and optimization of sequences with prescribed constraints, an in silico analysis and filtering step, and experimental validation. The vision is to enable computational de novo design of {RNA} devices with high success rate and thus to reduce laboratory efforts significantly.
Thus, I developed methods and tools to improve especially the computational steps of this pipeline. A dynamic programming algorithm based on graph coloring allows to uniformly sample {RNA} sequences given various constraints. The resulting library implementation, {RNAblueprint}, enables to flexibly combine it with arbitrary evaluation and optimization methods. New objective function terms describe the mechanism of specific {RNA} devices in an elaborate way. We use probabilities and concentrations of structural elements, techniques to model ligand binding, target specific kinetic behavior, or apply extensive transcription/translation models. New visualization tools and the investigation of filtering and clustering techniques improve the analysis step. Finally, laboratory methods are proposed to verify the desired functionality of the designed systems in their target environment.},

	abstract = {Background
{RNA} pseudoknots play important roles in many biological processes. Previous methods for comparative pseudoknot analysis mainly focus on simultaneous folding and alignment of {RNA} sequences. Little work has been done to align two known {RNA} secondary structures with pseudoknots taking into account both sequence and structure information of the two {RNAs}.

Results
In this article we present a novel method for aligning two known {RNA} secondary structures with pseudoknots. We adopt the partition function methodology to calculate the posterior log-odds scores of the alignments between bases or base pairs of the two {RNAs} with a dynamic programming algorithm. The posterior log-odds scores are then used to calculate the expected accuracy of an alignment between the {RNAs}. The goal is to find an optimal alignment with the maximum expected accuracy. We present a heuristic to achieve this goal. The performance of our method is investigated and compared with existing tools for {RNA} structure alignment. An extension of the method to multiple alignment of pseudoknot structures is also discussed.

Conclusions
The method described here has been implemented in a tool named {RKalign}, which is freely accessible on the Internet. As more and more pseudoknots are revealed, collected and stored in public databases, we anticipate a tool like {RKalign} will play a significant role in data comparison, annotation, analysis, and retrieval in these databases.

	abstract = {Fifty-three {RNA} duplexes containing two single nucleotide bulge loops were optically melted in 1 M {NaCl} in order to determine the thermodynamic parameters ΔH°, ΔS°, ΔG°37, and {TM} for each duplex. Because of the large number of possible combinations and lack of sequence effects observed previously, we limited our initial investigation to adenosine bulges, the most common naturally occurring bulge. For example, the following duplexes were investigated: 5′{GGCAXYAGGC}/3′{CCG} {YX} {CCG}, 5′{GGCAXY} {GCC}/3′{CCG} {YXACGG}, and 5′{GGC} {XYAGCC}/3′{CCGAYX} {CGG}. The identity of {XY} (where {XY} are Watson–Crick base pairs) and the total number of base pairs in the terminal and central stems were varied. As observed for duplexes with a single bulge loop, the effect of the two bulge loops on duplex stability is primarily influenced by non-nearest neighbor interactions. In particular, the stability of the stems influences the destabilization of the duplex by the inserted bulge loops. The model proposed to predict the influence of multiple bulge loops on duplex stability suggests that the destabilization of each bulge is related to the stability of the adjacent stems. A database of {RNA} secondary structures was examined to determine the naturally occurring abundance of duplexes containing multiple bulge loops. Of the 2000 examples found in the database, over 65\% of the two bulge loops occur within 3 base pairs of each other. A database of {RNA} three-dimensional structures was examined to determine the structure of duplexes containing two single nucleotide bulge loops. The structures of the bulge loops are described.},

	abstract = {Background
A large class of {RNA} secondary structure prediction programs uses an elaborate energy model grounded in extensive thermodynamic measurements and exact dynamic programming algorithms. External experimental evidence can be in principle be incorporated by means of hard constraints that restrict the search space or by means of soft constraints that distort the energy model. In particular recent advances in coupling chemical and enzymatic probing with sequencing techniques but also comparative approaches provide an increasing amount of experimental data to be combined with secondary structure prediction.

Results
Responding to the increasing needs for a versatile and user-friendly inclusion of external evidence into diverse flavors of {RNA} secondary structure prediction tools we implemented a generic layer of constraint handling into the {ViennaRNA} Package. It makes explicit use of the conceptual separation of the “folding grammar” defining the search space and the actual energy evaluation, which allows constraints to be interleaved in a natural way between recursion steps and evaluation of the standard energy function.

Conclusions
The extension of the {ViennaRNA} Package provides a generic way to include diverse types of constraints into {RNA} folding algorithms. The computational overhead incurred is negligible in practice. A wide variety of application scenarios can be accommodated by the new framework, including the incorporation of structure probing data, non-standard base pairs and chemical modifications, as well as structure-dependent ligand binding.

bulges in {RNA} commonly occur in nature. Yet, little
data exists concerning the thermodynamic parameters of this motif.
Algorithms that predict {RNA} secondary structure from sequence currently
attribute a constant free energy value of 3.2 kcal/mol to all trinucleotide
bulges, regardless of bulge sequence. To test the accuracy of this
model, {RNA} duplexes that contain frequent naturally occurring trinucleotide
bulges were optically melted, and their thermodynamic parameters—enthalpy,
entropy, free energy, and melting temperature—were determined.
The thermodynamic data were used to derive a new model to predict
the free energy contribution of trinucleotide bulges to {RNA} duplex
stability: ΔG°37, trint bulge = ΔG°37, bulge + ΔG°37, {AU} + ΔG°37, {GU}. The parameter ΔG°37, bulge is variable depending upon the purine
and pyrimidine composition of the bulge, ΔG°37, {AU} is a 0.49 kcal/mol penalty for an A-U
closing pair, and ΔG° 37, {GU} is a −0.56 kcal/mol bonus for a G-U closing pair. With both
closing pair and bulge sequence taken into account, this new model
predicts free energy values within 0.30 kcal/mol of the experimental
value. The new model can be used by algorithms that predict {RNA} free
energies as well as algorithms that use free energy minimization to
predict {RNA} secondary structure from sequence.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Secondary structure forms an important intermediate level of description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the dominating part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is routinely used as a basis to explain experimental findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters, exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties.
{RESULTS}: The {ViennaRNA} Package has been a widely used compilation of {RNA} secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core {CPUs}, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying {RNAlib} and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess {RNA}-{RNA} interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12796},
	shorttitle = {{ThreshKnot}},
	abstract = {{RNA} structure prediction is a challenging problem, especially with pseudoknots. Recently, there has been a shift from the classical minimum free energy-based methods ({MFE}) to partition function-based ones that assemble structures using base-pairing probabilities. Two examples of the latter group are the popular maximum expected accuracy ({MEA}) method and the {ProbKnot} method. {ProbKnot} is a fast heuristic that pairs nucleotides that are reciprocally most probable pairing partners, and unlike {MEA}, can also predict structures with pseudoknots. However, {ProbKnot}'s full potential has been largely overlooked. In particular, when introduced, it did not have an {MEA}-like hyperparameter that can balance between positive predictive value ({PPV}) and sensitivity. We show that a simple thresholded version of {ProbKnot}, which we call {ThreshKnot}, leads to more accurate overall predictions by filtering out unlikely pairs whose probabilities fall under a given threshold. We also show that on three widely-used folding engines ({RNAstructure}, Vienna {RNAfold}, and {CONTRAfold}), {ThreshKnot} always outperforms the much more involved {MEA} algorithm in (1) its higher structure prediction accuracy, (2) its capability to predict pseudoknots, and (3) its faster runtime and easier implementation. This suggests that {ThreshKnot} should replace {MEA} as the default partition function-based structure prediction algorithm. {ThreshKnot} is already available in the widely used {RNAstructure} software package version 6.2 (released November 27, 2019): https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/{RNAstructure}.html},

Proposed approach is unique in the sense: it is the first idea so far which works on optimization of the model length; also it is the first swarm intelligence technique that is proposed for training {csHMM}. The two-level strategy with training and cross training sets helps in increasing the diversity of the particles so as to avoid trapping in local optima, yields more accurate estimation parameters, preserves the structure of the model and provides the best compression from the model. {TL}-{PSO} yields a trained stochastic model with position-dependent probabilities that achieves high prediction ratios than the compared non-stochastic scoring matrix based {csHMM} approaches. {TL}-{PSO} is also tested solely for sequence alignment of proteins, by training the conventional {HMMs}. {TLPSO}-{HMM} produces an effective framework for sequence alignment in terms of alignment quality and prediction accuracy than the competitive state-of-the-art and family of {PSO} based algorithms.

Although many algorithms are available to make these predictions, the inclusion of non-nested loops, termed pseudoknots, still poses challenges arising from two main factors: 1) no physical model exists to estimate the loop entropies of complex intramolecular pseudoknots, and 2) their {NP}-complete enumeration has impeded their study. Here, we address both challenges. First, we develop a polymer physics model that can address arbitrarily complex pseudoknots using only two parameters corresponding to concrete physical quantities—over an order of magnitude fewer than the sparsest state-of-the-art phenomenological methods. Second, by coupling this model to exhaustive enumeration of the set of possible structures, we compute the entire free energy landscape of secondary structures resulting from a primary {RNA} sequence. We demonstrate that for {RNA} structures of ∼80 nucleotides, with minimal heuristics, the complete enumeration of possible secondary structures can be accomplished quickly despite the {NP}-complete nature of the problem. We further show that despite our loop entropy model’s parametric sparsity, it performs better than or on par with previously published methods in predicting both pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted structures on a benchmark data set of {RNA} structures of ≤80 nucleotides. We suggest ways in which the accuracy of the model can be further improved.},

	abstract = {Comparison of {RNA} structures is one of the most crucial analysis for elucidating their individual functions and promoting medical applications. Because it is widely accepted that their functions and structures are strongly correlated, various methods for {RNA} secondary structure analysis have been proposed owing to the difficulty in predicting {RNA} three-dimensional structure directly from its sequence. However, there are few methods dealing with {RNA} secondary structures with a specific and complex partial structure called pseudoknot despite its significance to biological process, which is a big obstacle for analyzing their functions. In this study, we propose a novel tree representation of pseudoknotted {RNA} secondary structures by topological centroid identification and their comparison methods based on the tree edit distance. In the proposed method, a given graph representing an {RNA} secondary structure is transformed to a tree rooted at one of the vertices constituting the topological centroid that is identified by removing cycles with peeling processing for the graph. When comparing tree-represented {RNA} secondary structures collected from a public database using the tree edit distance and functional gene groups defined by Gene Ontology ({GO}), the proposed method showed better clustering results according to their {GOs} than canonical {RNA} sequence-based comparison. In addition, we also report a case that the combination of the tree edit distance and the sequence edit distance shows a better classification of the pseudoknotted {RNA} secondary structures.},

	abstract = {{RNA} secondary structure prediction is a fundamental problem in structural bioinformatics. The prediction problem is difficult because {RNA} secondary structures may contain pseudoknots formed by crossing base pairs. We introduce k-partite secondary structures as a simple classification of {RNA} secondary structures with pseudoknots. An {RNA} secondary structure is k-partite if it is the union of k pseudoknot-free sub-structures. Most known {RNA} secondary structures are either bipartite or tripartite. We show that there exists a constant number k such that any secondary structure can be modified into a k-partite secondary structure with approximately the same free energy. This offers a partial explanation of the prevalence of k-partite secondary structures with small k. We give a complete characterization of the computational complexities of recognizing k-partite secondary structures for all k ≥ 2, and show that this recognition problem is essentially the same as the k-colorability problem on circle graphs. We present two simple heuristics, iterated peeling and first-fit packing, for finding k-partite {RNA} secondary structures. For maximizing the number of base pair stackings, our iterated peeling heuristic achieves a constant approximation ratio of at most k for 2 ≤ k ≤ 5, and at most 61−(1−6/k)k≤61−e−6{\textless}6.0149161−(1−6/k)k≤61−e−6{\textless}6.01491{\textbackslash}frac6\{1-(1-6/k){\textasciicircum}k\} {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}frac6\{1-e{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\} {\textless} 6.01491 for k ≥ 6. Experiment on sequences from {PseudoBase} shows that our first-fit packing heuristic outperforms the leading method {HotKnots} in predicting {RNA} secondary structures with pseudoknots.

Classic applications of {RNA} dynamic programming (Energy minimization, partition function, base-pair probabilities…) are reformulated within this framework, giving rise to very simple algorithms. This reformulation allows one to conceptually detach the conformation space/energy model – captured by the hypergraph model – from the specific application, assuming unambiguity of the decomposition. To ensure the latter property, we propose a new combinatorial methodology based on generating functions. We extend the set of generic applications by proposing an exact algorithm for extracting generalized moments in weighted distribution, generalizing a prior contribution by Miklos and al. Finally, we illustrate our full-fledged programme on three exemplary conformation spaces (secondary structures, Akutsu’s simple type pseudoknots and kissing hairpins). This readily gives sets of algorithms that are either novel or have complexity comparable to classic implementations for minimization and Boltzmann ensemble applications of dynamic programming.},

Here we undertake a synthesis of central concepts for evolutionary predictions, based on examples of microbial and viral systems, cancer cell populations, and immune receptor repertoires. These systems have strikingly similar evolutionary dynamics driven by the competition of clades within a population. These dynamics are the basis for models that predict the evolution of clade frequencies, as well as broad genetic and phenotypic changes. Moreover, there are strong links between prediction and control, which are important for interventions such as vaccine or therapy design. All of these are key elements of what may become a predictive theory of evolution.},

The slow phase displays hallmarks of a misfolded intermediate., Conclusion: This {RNA} accumulates a misfolded intermediate and interacts productively with {RNA} chaperones., Significance: Delineating misfolding and chaperone roles is crucial for understanding how cellular {RNAs} fold., Structured {RNAs} traverse complex energy landscapes that include valleys representing misfolded intermediates. In Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, efficient splicing of mitochondrial group I and {II} introns requires the {DEAD} box proteins {CYT}-19 and Mss116p, respectively, which promote folding transitions and function as general {RNA} chaperones. To test the generality of {RNA} misfolding and the activities of {DEAD} box proteins in vitro, here we measure native folding of a small group I intron ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus by monitoring its catalytic activity. To develop this assay, we first measure cleavage of an oligonucleotide substrate by the prefolded ribozyme. Substrate cleavage is rate-limited by binding and is readily reversible, with an internal equilibrium near unity, such that the amount of product observed is less than the amount of native ribozyme. We use this assay to show that approximately half of the ribozyme folds readily to the native state, whereas the other half forms an intermediate that transitions slowly to the native state. This folding transition is accelerated by urea and increased temperature and slowed by increased Mg2+ concentration, suggesting that the intermediate is misfolded and must undergo transient unfolding during refolding to the native state. {CYT}-19 and Mss116p accelerate refolding in an {ATP}-dependent manner, presumably by disrupting structure in the intermediate. These results highlight the tendency of {RNAs} to misfold, underscore the roles of {CYT}-19 and Mss116p as general {RNA} chaperones, and identify a refolding transition for further dissection of the roles of {DEAD} box proteins in {RNA} folding.},

The guanosine (G) substrate binds to the Azoarcus and Tetrahymena ribozymes with similar equilibrium binding constants and similar very slow association rate constants. These and additional literature observations support a model in which the free ribozyme is not conformationally competent to bind G and in which the probability of assuming the binding-competent state is determined by tertiary interactions of peripheral elements. As proposed previously, the slow binding of guanosine may play a role in the specificity of group I intron self-splicing, and slow binding may be used analogously in other biological processes. The internal equilibrium between ribozyme-bound substrates and products is similar for these ribozymes, but the Azoarcus ribozyme does not display the coupling in the binding of substrates that is observed with the Tetrahymena ribozyme, suggesting that local preorganization of the active site and rearrangements within the active site upon substrate binding are different for these ribozymes. Our results also confirm the much greater tertiary binding energy of the 5′-splice site analog with the Azoarcus ribozyme, binding energy that presumably compensates for the fewer base-pairing interactions to allow the 5′-exon intermediate in self splicing to remain bound subsequent to 5′-exon cleavage and prior to exon ligation. Most generally, these frameworks provide a foundation for design and interpretation of experiments investigating fundamental properties of these and other structured {RNAs}.},

Understanding the reach of neutral evolution is therefore a key problem linking diversity, robustness and evolvability at the molecular scale. While this process is usually described as a random walk in sequence space with clock-like regularity, new effects can arise in large microbial or viral populations where new mutants arise before old ones can fix. Here I show that the clonal interference of neutral variants shuts off the access to neutral ridges and thus induces localization within the robust cores of neutral networks. As a result, larger populations can be less effective at exploring sequence space than smaller ones—a counterintuitive limitation to evolvability which invalidates analogies between evolution and percolation. I illustrate these effects by revisiting Maynard Smith’s word-game model of protein evolution. Interestingly, the phenomenon of neutral interference connects evolutionary dynamics to a Markov process known in network science as the maximal-entropy random walk; its special properties imply that, when many neutral variants interfere in a population, evolution chooses mutational paths—not individual mutations—uniformly at random.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Pseudoknots are a fundamental {RNA} tertiary structure with important roles in regulation of {mRNA} translation. Molecular force spectroscopic approaches such as optical tweezers can track the pseudoknot's unfolding intermediate states by pulling the {RNA} chain from both ends, but the kinetic unfolding pathway induced by this method may be different from that in vivo, which occurs during translation and proceeds from the 5' to 3' end. Here we developed a ribosome-mimicking, nanopore pulling assay for dissecting the vectorial unfolding mechanism of pseudoknots. The pseudoknot unfolding pathway in the nanopore, either from the 5' to 3' end or in the reverse direction, can be controlled by a {DNA} leader that is attached to the pseudoknot at the 5' or 3' ends. The different nanopore conductance between {DNA} and {RNA} translocation serves as a marker for the position and structure of the unfolding {RNA} in the pore. With this design, we provided evidence that the pseudoknot unfolding is a two-step, multistate, metal ion-regulated process depending on the pulling direction. Most notably, unfolding in both directions is rate-limited by the unzipping of the first helix domain (first step), which is Helix-1 in the 5' → 3' direction and Helix-2 in the 3' → 5' direction, suggesting that the initial unfolding step in either pulling direction needs to overcome an energy barrier contributed by the noncanonical triplex base-pairs and coaxial stacking interactions for the tertiary structure stabilization. These findings provide new insights into {RNA} vectorial unfolding mechanisms, which play an important role in biological functions including frameshifting.},

Each target test tube contains a set of desired “on-target” complexes, each with a target secondary structure and target concentration, and a set of undesired “off-target” complexes, each with vanishing target concentration. Optimization of the equilibrium ensemble properties of the target test tubes implements both a positive design paradigm, explicitly designing for on-pathway elementary steps, and a negative design paradigm, explicitly designing against off-pathway crosstalk. Sequence design is performed subject to diverse user-specified sequence constraints including composition constraints, complementarity constraints, pattern prevention constraints, and biological constraints.

We present an implementation of the algorithm that generates the optimal minimum energy structure for a single {RNA} sequence, using standard {RNA} folding thermodynamic parameters augmented by a few parameters describing the thermodynamic stability of pseudoknots. We demonstrate the properties of the algorithm by using it to predict structures for several small pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted {RNAs}. Although the time and memory demands of the algorithm are steep, we believe this is the first algorithm to be able to fold optimal (minimum energy) pseudoknotted {RNAs} with the accepted {RNA} thermodynamic model.},

	abstract = {{RNA} secondary structure prediction is an important issue in structural bioinformatics, and {RNA} pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction represents an {NP}-hard problem. Recently, many different machine-learning methods, Markov models, and neural networks have been employed for this problem, with encouraging results regarding their predictive accuracy; however, their performances are usually limited by the requirements of the learning model and over-fitting, which requires use of a fixed number of training features. Because most natural biological sequences have variable lengths, the sequences have to be truncated before the features are employed by the learning model, which not only leads to the loss of information but also destroys biological-sequence integrity.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btm223},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Accurate prediction of {RNA} secondary structure from the base sequence is an unsolved computational challenge. The accuracy of predictions made by free energy minimization is limited by the quality of the energy parameters in the underlying free energy model. The most widely used model, the Turner99 model, has hundreds of parameters, and so a robust parameter estimation scheme should efficiently handle large data sets with thousands of structures. Moreover, the estimation scheme should also be trained using available experimental free energy data in addition to structural data.
{RESULTS}: In this work, we present constraint generation ({CG}), the first computational approach to {RNA} free energy parameter estimation that can be efficiently trained on large sets of structural as well as thermodynamic data. Our {CG} approach employs a novel iterative scheme, whereby the energy values are first computed as the solution to a constrained optimization problem. Then the newly computed energy parameters are used to update the constraints on the optimization function, so as to better optimize the energy parameters in the next iteration. Using our method on biologically sound data, we obtain revised parameters for the Turner99 energy model. We show that by using our new parameters, we obtain significant improvements in prediction accuracy over current state of-the-art methods.

Sequences from this study were combined with sequences from previous studies [Longfellow, C. E., et al. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 278-285; Znosko, B. M., et al. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 10406-10417], thus examining all possible group I single-nucleotide bulge loop and nearest-neighbor sequence combinations. The free energy increments at 37 degrees C for the introduction of a group I single-nucleotide bulge loop range between 1.3 and 5.2 kcal/mol. The combined data were used to develop a model for predicting the free energy of a {RNA} duplex containing a single-nucleotide bulge. For bulge loops with adjacent Watson-Crick base pairs, neither the identity of the bulge nor the nearest-neighbor base pairs had an effect on the influence of the bulge loop on duplex stability. The proposed model for prediction of the stability of a duplex containing a bulged nucleotide was primarily affected by non-nearest-neighbor interactions. The destabilization of the duplex by the bulge was related to the stability of the stems adjacent to the bulge. Specifically, there was a direct correlation between the destabilization of the duplex and the stability of the less stable duplex stem. The stability of a duplex containing a bulged nucleotide adjacent to a wobble base pair also was primarily affected by non-nearest-neighbor interactions. Again, there was a direct correlation between the destabilization of the duplex and the stability of the less stable duplex stem. However, when one or both of the bulge nearest neighbors was a wobble base pair, the free energy increment for insertion of a bulge loop is dependent upon the position and orientation of the wobble base pair relative the bulged nucleotide. Bulge sequences of the type ((5'{UBX})(3'{GY})), ((5'{GBG})(3'{UU})) and ((5'{UBU})(3'{GG})) are less destabilizing by 0.6 kcal/mol, and bulge sequences of the type ((5'{GBX})(3'{UY})) and ((5'{XBU})(3'{YG})) are more destabilizing by 0.4 kcal/mol than bulge loops adjacent to Watson-Crick base pairs.},

Despite the small size of the Azoarcus ribozyme (195 nucleotides (nt)), it binds tightly to the guanosine nucleophile (Kd=15±3 μM) and exhibits activity at high temperatures (∼60–70°C). These features may be due to the two {GA}3 tetraloop interactions postulated in the intron and the high {GC} content of the secondary structure. The second order rate constant for the Azoarcus ribozyme, ((kcat/Km)S=8.4±2.1×10−5 M−1 min−1) is close to that found for the related ribozyme derived from the pre-{tRNAIle} of the cyanobacterium Anabaena {PCC}7120. {pH} dependence studies and kinetic analyses of deoxy-substituted substrates suggest that the chemical cleavage step is the rate-determining process in the Azoarcus ribozyme. This may be due to the short 3-nt guide sequence–substrate pairing present in the Azoarcus ribozyme. Finally, the Azoarcus ribozyme shares features conserved in other group I ribozymes including the {pH} profile, the stereospecificity for the Rp-phosphorothioate at the cleavage site and the 1000-fold decrease in cleavage rate with a deoxyribonucleoside leaving group.},

An algorithm is designed for ordered trees. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(¦T1¦· s¦T2· (deg(T1) + deg(T2))2), where ¦Ti¦ is the number of nodes in T i and deg(T i ) is the degree of T i , i=1,2. The algorithm is faster than the best known algorithm for tree edit when deg(T1) and deg(T2) are smaller than the depths of T1 and T2. For unordered trees, we show that the alignment problem can be solved in polynomial time if the trees have a bounded degree and becomes {NP}-hard if one of the trees is allowed to have an arbitrary degree. In contrast, the edit problem for unordered trees is {NP}-hard even if both trees have a bounded degree [17]. Finally, multiple alignment of trees is discussed.},

The computation of the ‘hybrid probabilities’ is complemented by a stochastic sampling algorithm that produces a Boltzmann weighted ensemble of {RNA}–{RNA} interaction structures. The sampling of k structures requires only negligible additional memory resources and runs in O(k·N3)., Availability: The algorithms described here are implemented in C as part of the rip package.

	abstract = {Motivation: Abstract shape analysis allows efficient computation of a representative sample of low-energy foldings of an {RNA} molecule. More comprehensive information is obtained by computing shape probabilities, accumulating the Boltzmann probabilities of all structures within each abstract shape. Such information is superior to free energies because it is independent of sequence length and base composition. However, up to this point, computation of shape probabilities evaluates all shapes simultaneously and comes with a computation cost which is exponential in the length of the sequence., Results: We device an approach called {RapidShapes} that computes the shapes above a specified probability threshold T by generating a list of promising shapes and constructing specialized folding programs for each shape to compute its share of Boltzmann probability. This aims at a heuristic improvement of runtime, while still computing exact probability values., Conclusion: Evaluating this approach and several substrategies, we find that only a small proportion of shapes have to be actually computed. For an {RNA} sequence of length 400, this leads, depending on the threshold, to a 10–138 fold speed-up compared with the previous complete method. Thus, probabilistic shape analysis has become feasible in medium-scale applications, such as the screening of {RNA} transcripts in a bacterial genome., Availability: {RapidShapes} is available via http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnashapes, Contact: robert@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, algorithms that can handle {RNA} secondary structures typically have high computational complexity that limits their utility. For this reason, there have been a number of attempts to find useful alignment constraints that can reduce the computations without sacrificing the alignment accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new method for finding effective alignment constraints for fast and accurate structural alignment of {RNAs}, including pseudoknots. In the proposed method, we use a profile-{HMM} to identify the â€œseedâ€ regions that can be aligned with high confidence. We also estimate the position range of the aligned bases that are located outside the seed regions. The location of the seed regions and the estimated range of the alignment positions are then used to establish the sequence alignment constraints. We incorporated the proposed constraints into the profile context-sensitive {HMM} (profile-{csHMM}) based {RNA} structural alignment algorithm. Experiments indicate that the proposed method can make the alignment speed up to 11 times faster without degrading the accuracy of the {RNA} alignment.},

We look at five of these classes in greater detail. The time and space complexity of the alignment algorithm is increased by only a linear factor over the respective prediction algorithm. For four of the classes, no efficient alignment algorithms were known. For the fifth, most general class, we improve the previously best complexity of O(n 5 m 5) time to O(nm 6), where n and m denote sequence lengths.

In past decades, several methods have been developed to predict {RNA} structure with pseudoknots. Among them, metaheuristic approaches have proven to be beneficial for predicting long {RNA} structure in a very short time. In this paper, we have used two metaheuristic algorithms; Genetic Algorithm ({GA}) and Simulated Annealing ({SA}) for predicting {RNA} secondary structure with pseudoknots. We have also applied a combination of these two algorithms as {GA}-{SA} where {GA} is used for a global search and {SA} is used for a local search, and conversely {SA}-{GA}, where {SA} is used for a global search and {GA} is used for a local search. Four different energy models have been applied to calculate the energy of {RNA} structure. Five datasets, constructed from the {RNA} {STRAND} and Pseudobase++ database, have been used in the algorithms. The performances of the algorithms have been compared with several existing metaheuristic algorithms. Here we have obtained that the combination of {GA} and {SA} ({GA}-{SA}) gives better results than {GA}, {SA} and {SA}-{GA} algorithms and all other four state-of-art algorithms on all datasets.},

	abstract = {While predicting the secondary structure of {RNA} is vital for researching its function, determining {RNA} secondary structure is challenging, especially for that with pseudoknots. Typically, several excellent computational methods can be utilized to predict the secondary structure (with or without pseudoknots), but they have their own merits and demerits. These methods can be classified into two categories: the multi-sequence method and the single-sequence method. The main advantage of the multi-sequence method lies in its use of the auxiliary sequences to assist in predicting the secondary structure, but it can only successfully predict in the presence of multiple highly homologous sequences. The single-sequence method is associated with the major merit of easy operation (only need the target sequence to predict secondary structure), but its folding parameters are the common features of diversity {RNA}, which cannot describe the unique characteristics of {RNA}, thus potentially resulting in the low prediction accuracy in some {RNA}. In this paper, ‘{DMfold}’, a method based on the Deep Learning and Improved Base Pair Maximization Principle, is proposed to predict the secondary structure with pseudoknots, which fully absorbs the advantages and avoids some disadvantages of those two methods. Notably, {DMfold} could predict the secondary structure of {RNA} by learning similar {RNA} in the known structures, which uses the similar {RNA} sequences instead of the highly homogeneous sequences in the multi-sequence method, thereby reducing the requirement for auxiliary sequences. In {DMfold}, it only needs to input the target sequence to predict the secondary structure. Its folding parameters are fully extracted automatically by deep learning, which could avoid the lack of folding parameters in the single-sequence method. Experiments show that our method is not only simple to operate, but also improves the prediction accuracy compared to multiple excellent prediction methods.

Our strategies have time/space complexities of O(n 4) / O(n 2), O(n 4) / O(n 3), and O(n 5) / O(n 2). All strategies have been implemented in the program {pKiss} and were evaluated against known structures. Surprisingly, our simplest strategy performs best. As it has the same complexity as the previous algorithm for simple pseudoknots, the overlay idea opens a way to construct a variety of practically useful algorithms for pseudoknots of higher topological complexity within O(n 4) time and O(n 2) space.},

The approach is based on simulating a folding process in a coarse-grained manner by choosing helices based on established energy rules. The steric feasibility of the chosen set of helices is checked during the folding process using a highly coarse-grained 3D model of the {RNA} structures. Using two data sets of 26 and 241 {RNA} sequences we find that this approach is competitive compared to the existing {RNA} secondary structure prediction programs {pknotsRG}, {HotKnots} and {UnaFold}. The key advantages of the new method are that there is no algorithmic restriction in terms of pseudoknot complexity and a test is made for steric feasibility.

	abstract = {Background
Improving accuracy and efficiency of computational methods that predict pseudoknotted {RNA} secondary structures is an ongoing challenge. Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information.

Results
We present a new method, Iterative {HFold}, for pseudoknotted {RNA} secondary structure prediction. Iterative {HFold} takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative {HFold} leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of {HFold}, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of {HotKnots} V2.0., Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative {HFold} is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54\% to 79\% as the user provides up to 40\% of the input structure., Iterative {HFold} is much faster than {HotKnots} V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative {HFold} also has significantly better accuracy than {IPknot} on our {HK}-{PK} and {IP}-pk168 data sets.

Conclusions
Iterative {HFold} is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted {RNA} secondary structures, whose accuracy with more than 5\% information about true pseudoknot-free structures is better than that of {IPknot}, and with about 35\% information about true pseudoknot-free structures compares well with that of {HotKnots} V2.0 while being significantly faster. Iterative {HFold} and all data used in this work are freely available at http://www.cs.ubc.ca/{\textasciitilde}hjabbari/software.php.

For this reason several codes have been simplified: in some cases they do not predict complex structures like pseudoknots, other times they predict structures with reduced lengths, or with simple pseudoknots. Each of these codes has its strengths and weaknesses. Providing scientists with tools that combine the strengths of the several codes is a worthwhile objective. To address this need, we present {compPknots}, a parallel framework that uses a combination of existing codes like Pknots-{RE} and Pknots-{RG}, to predict {RNA} secondary structures concurrently and automatically compare them with reference structures from databases or literature. In this paper {compPknots} is used to compare the predictions of 217 {RNA} structures from the {PseudoBase} database. Its parallel master-slave architecture provide scientists with higher prediction accuracies in shorter time.},

The approach, which combines comparative sequence analysis and structure prediction, already has yielded excellent results for a small number of aligned sequences and is suitable for large-scale genomic screens. It consists of two basic components: (i) a measure for {RNA} secondary structure conservation based on computing a consensus secondary structure, and (ii) a measure for thermodynamic stability, which, in the spirit of a z score, is normalized with respect to both sequence length and base composition but can be calculated without sampling from shuffled sequences. Functional {RNA} secondary structures can be identified in multiple sequence alignments with high sensitivity and high specificity. We demonstrate that this approach is not only much more accurate than previous methods but also significantly faster. The method is implemented in the program rnaz, which can be downloaded from www.tbi.univie.ac.at/{\textasciitilde}wash/{RNAz}. We screened all alignments of length n {\textgreater} or = 50 in the Comparative Regulatory Genomics database, which compiles conserved noncoding elements in upstream regions of orthologous genes from human, mouse, rat, Fugu, and zebrafish. We recovered all of the known noncoding {RNAs} and cis-acting elements with high significance and found compelling evidence for many other conserved {RNA} secondary structures not described so far to our knowledge.},

Methods have previously been developed to model {RNA} stem-loops successfully using stochastic context-free grammars ({SCFG}) adapted from computational linguistics; however, the additional complexity of pseudoknots has made modeling them more difficult. Formally a context-sensitive grammar is required, which would impose a large increase in complexity.
{RESULTS}: We introduce a new grammar modeling approach for {RNA} pseudoknotted structures based on parallel communicating grammar systems ({PCGS}). Our new approach can specify pseudoknotted structures, while avoiding context-sensitive rules, using a single {CFG} synchronized with a number of regular grammars. Technically, the stochastic version of the grammar model can be as simple as an {SCFG}. As with {SCFG}, the new approach permits automatic generation of a single-{RNA} structure prediction algorithm for each specified pseudoknotted structure model. This approach also makes it possible to develop full probabilistic models of pseudoknotted structures to allow the prediction of consensus structures by comparative analysis and structural homology recognition in database searches.},

Hence, it is clear that any method that relates {RNA} sequences in form of (multiple) alignments should take structural features into account. Since multiple alignments are of great importance for subsequent data analysis, research in improving the speed and accuracy of such alignments benefits many other analysis problems.We present a formulation for computing provably optimal, structure-based, multiple {RNA} alignments and give an algorithm that finds such an optimal (or near-optimal) solution. To solve the resulting computational problem we propose an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation which already proved successful in the two-sequence case. We compare our implementation, {mLARA}, to three programs ({clustalW}, {MARNA}, and pmmulti) and demonstrate that we can often compute multiple alignments with consensus structures that have a significant lower minimum free energy term than computed by the other programs. Our prototypical experiments show that our new algorithm is competitive and, in contrast to other methods, is applicable to long sequences where standard dynamic programming approaches must fail. Furthermore, the Lagrangian method is capable of handling arbitrary pseudoknot structures.},

	abstract = {An {RNA} molecule is structured on several layers. The primary and most obvious structure is its sequence of bases, i.e. a word over the alphabet \{A,C,G,U\}. The higher structure is a set of one-to-one base-pairings resulting in a two-dimensional folding of the one-dimensional sequence. One speaks of a secondary structure if these pairings do not cross and of a tertiary structure otherwise. Since the folding of the molecule is important for its function, the search for related {RNA} molecules should not only be restricted to the primary structure. It seems sensible to incorporate the higher structures in the search. Based on this assumption and certain edit-operations a distance between two arbitrary structures can be defined. It is known that the general calculation of this measure is {NP}-complete {\textbackslash}cite\{zhang02similarity\}. But for some special cases polynomial algorithms are known. Using a new formal description of secondary and tertiary structures, we extend the class of structures for which the distance can be calculated in polynomial time. In addition the presented algorithm may be used to approximate the edit-distance between two arbitrary structures with a constant ratio.},

For secondary structures, these bonds have been traditionally assumed to be one to one and non-crossing. This paper considers a notion of similarity between two {RNA} molecule structures taking into account the primary, the secondary and the tertiary structures. We show that, for tertiary structures, it is Max {SNP}-hard for both minimization and maximization versions. We show a stronger result for the maximization version where it cannot be approximated within ratio 2logδn in polynomial time, unless {NP}⊆{DTIME}[2polylogn].

Aligning a known {ncRNA} to a target candidate to determine the sequence and structural similarity helps in identifying de novo {ncRNA} molecules that are in the same family of the known {ncRNA}. However, existing algorithms cannot handle complex pseudoknot structures which are found in nature. In this paper, we propose algorithms to handle two types of complex pseudoknots: simple non-standard pseudoknots and recursive pseudoknots. Although our methods are not designed for general pseudoknots, it already cover all known {ncRNAs} in both Rfam and {PseudoBase} databases. A preliminary evaluation on our algorithms show that it is useful to identify {ncRNA} molecules in other species which are in the same family of a known {ncRNA}.},

These maps are non-invertible since there are always many orders of magnitude more sequences than structures. Sequences folding into identical structures formneutral networks. A neutral network is embedded in the set of sequences that arecompatible with the given structure. Networks are modeled as graphs and constructed by random choice of vertices from the space of compatible sequences. The theory characterizes neutral networks by the mean fraction of neutral neighbors (λ). The networks are connected and percolate sequence space if the fraction of neutral nearest neighbors exceeds a threshold value (λ{\textgreater}λ*). Below threshold (λ{\textless}λ*), the networks are partitioned into a largest “giant” component and several smaller components. Structure are classified as “common” or “rare” according to the sizes of their pre-images, i.e. according to the fractions of sequences folding into them. The neutral networks of any pair of two different common structures almost touch each other, and, as expressed by the conjecture ofshape space covering sequences folding into almost all common structures, can be found in a small ball of an arbitrary location in sequence space. The results from random graph theory are compared to data obtained by folding large samples of {RNA} sequences.

	abstract = {Background
{RNAs} are attractive molecules as the biological parts for synthetic biology. In particular, the ability of conformational changes, which can be encoded in designer {RNAs}, enables us to create multistable molecular switches that function in biological circuits. Although various algorithms for designing such {RNA} switches have been proposed, the previous algorithms optimize the {RNA} sequences against the weighted sum of objective functions, where empirical weights among objective functions are used. In addition, an {RNA} design algorithm for multiple pseudoknot targets is currently not available.

Results
We developed a novel computational tool for automatically designing {RNA} sequences which fold into multiple target secondary structures. Our algorithm designs {RNA} sequences based on multi-objective genetic algorithm, by which we can explore the {RNA} sequences having good objective function values without empirical weight parameters among the objective functions. Our algorithm has great flexibility by virtue of this weight-free nature. We benchmarked our multi-target {RNA} design algorithm with the datasets of two, three, and four target structures and found that our algorithm shows better or comparable design performances compared with the previous algorithms, {RNAdesign} and Frnakenstein. In addition to the benchmarks with pseudoknot-free datasets, we benchmarked {MODENA} with two-target pseudoknot datasets and found that {MODENA} can design the {RNAs} which have the target pseudoknotted secondary structures whose free energies are close to the lowest free energy. Moreover, we applied our algorithm to a ribozyme-based {ON}-switch which takes a ribozyme-inactive secondary structure when the theophylline aptamer structure is assumed.

Conclusions
Currently, {MODENA} is the only {RNA} design software which can be applied to multiple pseudoknot targets. Successful design results for the multiple targets and an {RNA} device indicate usefulness of our multi-objective {RNA} design algorithm.

Because of their impact on evolutionary processes, the characteristics of these {NCs}, like their size or robustness, have been studied extensively. Here, we introduce a framework that allows the estimation of {NC} size and robustness in the {GP} map of {RNA} secondary structure. The advantage of this framework is that it only requires small samples of genotypes and their local environment, which also allows experimental realizations. We verify our framework by applying it to the exhaustively analysable {GP} map of {RNA} sequence length L = 15, and benchmark it against an existing method by applying it to longer, naturally occurring functional non-coding {RNA} sequences. Although it is specific to the {RNA} secondary structure {GP} map in the first place, our framework can probably be transferred and adapted to other sequence-to-structure {GP} maps.},

As in proteins, {SCA} reveals a hierarchical organization of evolutionary constraints with near-independent groups of nucleotides forming physically contiguous networks within the three-dimensional structure. Using a quantitative, continuous-culture-with-deep-sequencing assay, we confirm that the top two {SCA}-predicted sectors contribute to ribosome function. These sectors map to distinct ribosome activities, and their origins trace to phylogenetic divergences across all domains of life. These findings provide a foundation to map ribosome allostery, explore ribosome biogenesis, and engineer ribosomes for new functions.

	abstract = {Dynamic job shop scheduling ({JSS}) problems with dynamic job arrivals have been studied extensively in the literature due to their applicability to real-world manufacturing systems, such as semiconductor manufacturing. In a dynamic {JSS} problem with dynamic job arrivals, jobs arrive on the shop floor unannounced that need to be processed by the machines on the shop floor. A job has a sequence of operations that can only processed on specific machines, and machines can only process one job at a time. Many effective genetic programming based hyper-heuristic ({GP}-{HH}) approaches have been proposed for dynamic {JSS} problems with dynamic job arrivals, where high quality dispatching rules are automatically evolved by {GP} to handle the dynamic {JSS} problem instances. However, research that focus on handling multiple dynamic events simultaneously are limited, such as both dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns. A machine breakdown event results in the affected machine being unable to process any jobs during the repair time. It is likely that machine breakdowns can significantly affect the effectiveness of the scheduling procedure unless they are explicitly accounted for. Therefore, this paper develops new machine breakdown terminals for a {GP} approach and evaluates their effectiveness for a dynamic {JSS} problem with both dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns. The results show that the {GP} approaches with the machine breakdown terminals do show improvements. The analysis shows that the machine breakdown terminals may indirectly contribute in the evolution of high quality rules, but occur infrequently in the output rules evolved by the machine breakdown {GP} approaches.},

In a previous contribution, the concepts of optimally aligned and optimally coplanar individuals were introduced, and it was shown that given optimally aligned, or optimally coplanar, individuals, it is possible to construct a globally optimal solution analytically. As a consequence, genetic programming methods, aimed at searching for optimally aligned, or optimally coplanar, individuals were introduced. In this paper, we critically discuss those methods, analyzing their major limitations and we propose new genetic programming systems aimed at overcoming those limitations. The presented experimental results, conducted on four real-life symbolic regression problems, show that the proposed algorithms outperform not only the existing methods based on the concept of alignment in the error space, but also geometric semantic genetic programming and standard genetic programming.},

	abstract = {Flexible Job Shop Scheduling ({FJSS}) problem has many real-world applications such as manufacturing and cloud computing, and thus is an important area of study. In real world, the environment is often dynamic, and unpredicted job orders can arrive in real time. Dynamic {FJSS} consists of challenges of both dynamic optimisation and the {FJSS} problem. In Dynamic {FJSS}, two kinds of decisions (so-called routing and sequencing decisions) are to be made in real time. Dispatching rules have been demonstrated to be effective for dynamic scheduling due to their low computational complexity and ability to make real-time decisions. However, it is time consuming and strenuous to design effective dispatching rules manually due to the complex interactions between job shop attributes. Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristic ({GPHH}) has shown success in automatically designing dispatching rules which are much better than the manually designed ones. Previous works only focused on standard job shop scheduling with only the sequencing decisions. For {FJSS}, the routing rule is set arbitrarily by intuition. In this paper, we explore the possibility of evolving both routing and sequencing rules together and propose a new {GPHH} algorithm with Cooperative Co-evolution. Our results show that co-evolving the two rules together can lead to much more promising results than evolving the sequencing rule only.},

However, making decisions regarding such domain specific issues is not an easy task, and is usually performed by hand, through an exhaustive trial-and-error process. Over the years, researches have developed and proposed methods to automatically train {ANNs}. One example is the {HyperNEAT} algorithm, which relies on {NeuroEvolution} of Augmenting Topologies ({NEAT}) to create Compositional Pattern Production Networks ({CPPNs}). {CPPNs} are networks that encode the mapping between neuron positions and the synaptic weight of the {ANN} connection between those neurons. Although this approach has obtained some success, it requires meticulous parameterisation to work properly. In this article we present a comparison of different Evolutionary Computation methods to evolve Compositional Pattern Production Functions: structures that have the same goal as {CPPNs}, but that are encoded as functions instead of networks. In addition to {NEAT} three methods are used to evolve such functions: Genetic Programming ({GP}), Grammatical Evolution, and Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution. The results show that {GP} is able to obtain competitive performance, often surpassing the other methods, without requiring the fine tuning of the parameters.},

In concrete we adapt ideas from Genetic Algorithms ({GAs}) and Grammatical Evolution ({GE}) to enable the evolution of sequences of layers and their parameters. We test our approach in the well-known image classification {CIFAR}-10 dataset. The results show that our method: (i) outperforms previous evolutionary approaches to the generations of {CNNs}; (ii) is able to create {CNNs} that have state-of-the-art performance while using less prior knowledge (iii) evolves {CNNs} with novel topologies, unlikely to be designed by hand. For instance, the best performing {CNN} obtained during evolution has an unexpected structure using six consecutive dense layers. On the {CIFAR}-10 the best model reports an average error of 5.87\% on test data.},

Genetic programming ({GP}) provides advanced analytical instruments for the investigation of multifactorial causes of metabolic diseases. In this article, we analyzed a population-based metabolomics dataset on osteoarthritis ({OA}) and developed a Linear {GP} ({LGP}) algorithm to search classification models that can best predict the disease outcome, as well as to identify the most important metabolic markers associated with the disease. The {LGP} algorithm was able to evolve prediction models with high accuracies especially with a more focused search using a reduced feature set that only includes potentially relevant metabolites.

The initial evaluation assessed the ability of {TPG} to discover agents capable of playing Atari game titles under the Arcade Learning Environment. This is an example of ‘visual’ reinforcement learning, i.e. agents are evolved directly from the frame buffer without recourse to hand designed features. {TPG} was able to evolve solutions competitive with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning solutions, but at a fraction of the complexity. One simplification assumed was that the visual input could be down sampled from a {\textbackslash}(210 {\textbackslash}times 160{\textbackslash}) resolution to {\textbackslash}(42 {\textbackslash}times 32{\textbackslash}). In this work, we consider the challenging 3D first person shooter environment of {ViZDoom} and require that agents be evolved at the original visual resolution of {\textbackslash}(320 {\textbackslash}times 240{\textbackslash}) pixels. In addition, we address issues for developing agents capable of operating in multi-task {ViZDoom} environments simultaneously. The resulting {TPG} solutions retain all the emergent properties of the original work as well as the computational efficiency. Moreover, solutions appear to generalize across multiple task scenarios, whereas equivalent solutions from deep reinforcement learning have focused on single task scenarios alone.},

A plethora of feature selection algorithms have been proposed, but it is difficult to truly analyse the quality of a given algorithm. Ideally, an algorithm would be evaluated by measuring how well it removes known bad features. Acquiring datasets with such features is inherently difficult, and so a common technique is to add synthetic bad features to an existing dataset. While adding noisy features is an easy task, it is very difficult to automatically add complex, redundant features. This work proposes one of the first approaches to generating redundant features, using a novel genetic programming approach. Initial experiments show that our proposed method can automatically create difficult, redundant features which have the potential to be used for creating high-quality feature selection benchmark datasets.},

Ensemble methods are widely used in machine learning due to their features: they average out biases, they reduce the variance and they usually generalize better than single models. Despite these advantages, building ensemble of {GP} models is not a well-developed topic in the evolutionary computation community. To fill this gap, we propose a strategy that blends individuals produced by standard syntax-based {GP} and individuals produced by geometric semantic genetic programming, one of the newest semantics-based method developed in {GP}. In fact, recent literature showed that combining syntax and semantics could improve the generalization ability of a {GP} model. Additionally, to improve the diversity of the {GP} models used to build up the ensemble, we propose different pruning criteria that are based on correlation and entropy, a commonly used measure in information theory. Experimental results, obtained over different complex problems, suggest that the pruning criteria based on correlation and entropy could be effective in improving the generalization ability of the ensemble model and in reducing the computational burden required to build it.},

We propose a framework based on a form of meta-evolution in which individuals are candidate representations expressed with an ad hoc language that we have developed to this purpose. Individuals compete and evolve according to an evolutionary search aimed at optimizing such representation properties as redundancy, locality, uniformity of redundancy.We assessed experimentally three variants of our framework on established benchmark problems and compared the resulting representations to human-designed representations commonly used (e.g., classical Grammatical Evolution). The results are promising in the sense that the evolved representations indeed exhibit better properties than the human-designed ones. Furthermore, while those improved properties do not result in a systematic improvement of search effectiveness, some of the evolved representations do improve search effectiveness over the human-designed baseline.},

	abstract = {Functional and kinetic constraints must be efficiently balanced during the folding process of all biopolymers. To understand how homologous {RNA} molecules with different global architectures fold into a common core structure we determined, under identical conditions, the folding mechanisms of three phylogenetically divergent group I intron ribozymes. These ribozymes share a conserved functional core defined by topologically equivalent tertiary motifs but differ in their primary sequence, size, and structural complexity. Time-resolved hydroxyl radical probing of the backbone solvent accessible surface and catalytic activity measurements integrated with structural-kinetic modeling reveal that each ribozyme adopts a unique strategy to attain the conserved functional fold. The folding rates are not dictated by the size or the overall structural complexity, but rather by the strength of the constituent tertiary motifs which, in turn, govern the structure, stability, and lifetime of the folding intermediates. A fundamental general principle of {RNA} folding emerges from this study: The dominant folding flux always proceeds through an optimally structured kinetic intermediate that has sufficient stability to act as a nucleating scaffold while retaining enough conformational freedom to avoid kinetic trapping. Our results also suggest a potential role of naturally selected peripheral A-minor interactions in balancing {RNA} structural stability with folding efficiency.},

	abstract = {{RNA} pseudoknots play a critical role in {RNA}-related biology from the assembly of ribosome to the regulation of viral gene expression. A predictive model for pseudoknot structure and stability is essential for understanding and designing {RNA} structure and function. A previous statistical mechanical theory allows us to treat canonical H-type {RNA} pseudoknots that contain no intervening loop between the helices (see S. Cao and S.J. Chen [2006] in Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 34; pp. 2634–2652). Biologically significant {RNA} pseudoknots often contain interhelix loops. Predicting the structure and stability for such more-general pseudoknots remains an unsolved problem. In the present study, we develop a predictive model for pseudoknots with interhelix loops. The model gives conformational entropy, stability, and the free-energy landscape from {RNA} sequences. The main features of this new model are the computation of the conformational entropy and folding free-energy base on the complete conformational ensemble and rigorous treatment for the excluded volume effects. Extensive tests for the structural predictions show overall good accuracy with average sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.91 and 0.91, respectively. The theory developed here may be a solid starting point for first-principles modeling of more complex, larger {RNAs}.},

	abstract = {{RNA} folding from sequences into secondary structures is a simple yet powerful, biophysically grounded model of a genotype-phenotype map in which concepts like plasticity, evolvability, epistasis, and modularity can not only be precisely defined and statistically measured but also reveal simultaneous and profoundly non-independent effects of natural selection. Molecular plasticity is viewed here as the capacity of an {RNA} sequence to assume a variety of energetically favorable shapes by equilibrating among them at constant temperature. Through simulations based on experimental designs, we study the dynamics of a population of {RNA} molecules that evolve toward a predefined target shape in a constant environment. Each shape in the plastic repertoire of a sequence contributes to the overall fitness of the sequence in proportion to the time the sequence spends in that shape. Plasticity is costly, since the more shapes a sequence can assume, the less time it spends in any one of them. Unsurprisingly, selection leads to a reduction of plasticity (environmental canalization). The most striking observation, however, is the simultaneous slow-down and eventual halting of the evolutionary process. The reduction of plasticity entails genetic canalization, that is, a dramatic loss of variability (and hence a loss of evolvability) to the point of lock-in. The causal bridge between environmental canalization and genetic canalization is provided by a correlation between the set of shapes in the plastic repertoire of a sequence and the set of dominant (minimum free energy) shapes in its genetic neighborhood. This statistical property of the {RNA} genotype-phenotype map, which we call plastogenetic congruence, traps populations in regions where most genetic variation is phenotypically neutral. We call this phenomenon neutral confinement. Analytical models of neutral confinement, made tractable by the assumption of perfect plastogenetic congruence, formally connect mutation rate, the topography of phenotype space, and evolvability. These models identify three mutational regimes: that corresponding to neutral confinement, an exploration threshold corresponding to a breakdown of neutral confinement with the simultaneous persistence of the dominant phenotype, and a classic error threshold corresponding to the loss of the dominant phenotype. In a final step, we analyze the structural properties of canalized phenotypes. The reduction of plasticity leads to extreme modularity, which we analyze from several perspectives: thermophysical (melting--the {RNA} version of a norm of reaction), kinetic (folding pathways--the {RNA} version of development), and genetic (transposability--the insensitivity to genetic context). The model thereby suggests a possible evolutionary origin of modularity as a side effect of environmental canalization.},

This approach indicates a functional architecture within proteins in which the basic units are coupled networks of amino acids termed sectors. This evolution-based decomposition has potential for new understandings of the structural basis for protein function. To facilitate its usage, we present here the principles and practice of the {SCA} and introduce new methods for sector analysis in a python-based software package ({pySCA}). We show that the pattern of amino acid interactions within sectors is linked to the divergence of functional lineages in a multiple sequence alignment—a model for how sector properties might be differentially tuned in members of a protein family. This work provides new tools for studying proteins and for generally testing the concept of sectors as the principal units of function and adaptive variation.},

Heavy investment in genomics and other molecular tools has fueled belief that those approaches can effectively predict adaptation into the future. I contest this view. Genome scans display the genomic footprints of the effects of natural selection and the other evolutionary processes over past generations, but it remains problematic to predict future change in mean fitness via genomic approaches. Here, I advocate for a direct approach to prediction of rates of ongoing adaptation. Following an overview of relevant quantitative genetic approaches, I outline the promise of the fundamental theorem of natural selection for the study of the adaptive process. Empirical implementation of this concept can productively guide efforts both to deepen scientific insight into the process of adaptation and to inform measures for conserving the biota in the face of rapid environmental change.},

To enhance the accuracy of secondary structure predictions, we developed and refined optimization techniques for the estimation of energy parameters. We build on two previous approaches to {RNA} free-energy parameter estimation: (1) the Constraint Generation ({CG}) method, which iteratively generates constraints that enforce known structures to have energies lower than other structures for the same molecule; and (2) the Boltzmann Likelihood ({BL}) method, which infers a set of {RNA} free-energy parameters that maximize the conditional likelihood of a set of reference {RNA} structures. Here, we extend these approaches in two main ways: We propose (1) a max-margin extension of {CG}, and (2) a novel linear Gaussian Bayesian network that models feature relationships, which effectively makes use of sparse data by sharing statistical strength between parameters. We obtain significant improvements in the accuracy of {RNA} minimum free-energy pseudoknot-free secondary structure prediction when measured on a comprehensive set of 2518 {RNA} molecules with reference structures. Our parameters can be used in conjunction with software that predicts {RNA} secondary structures, {RNA} hybridization, or ensembles of structures.

{SHAPE} experiments are used to probe the structure of {RNA} molecules. We present {ShaKer} to predict {SHAPE} data for {RNA} using a graph-kernel-based machine learning approach that is trained on experimental {SHAPE} information. While other available methods require a manually curated reference structure, {ShaKer} predicts reactivity data based on sequence input only and by sampling the ensemble of possible structures. Thus, {ShaKer} is well placed to enable experiment-driven, transcriptome-wide {SHAPE} data prediction to enable the study of {RNA} structuredness and to improve {RNA} structure and {RNA}–{RNA} interaction prediction. For performance evaluation, we use accuracy and accessibility comparing to experimental {SHAPE} data and competing methods. We can show that Shaker outperforms its competitors and is able to predict high quality {SHAPE} annotations even when no reference structure is provided.

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that simple stereochemical constraints encoded at the {RNA} secondary structure level significantly restrict the orientation of {RNA} helices across two-way junctions and yield physically reasonable distributions of {RNA} 3D conformations. Here we develop a new coarse-grain model, {TOPRNA}, that is optimized for exploring detailed aspects of these topological constraints in complex {RNA} systems. Unlike prior models, {TOPRNA} effectively treats {RNAs} as collections of semirigid helices linked by freely rotatable single strands, allowing us to isolate the effects of secondary structure connectivity and sterics on 3D structure. Simulations of bulge junctions show that {TOPRNA} captures new aspects of topological constraints, including variations arising from deviations in local A-form structure, translational displacements of the helices, and stereochemical constraints imposed by bulge-linker nucleotides. Notably, these aspects of topological constraints define free energy landscapes that coincide with the distribution of bulge conformations in the {PDB}. Our simulations also quantitatively reproduce {NMR} {RDC} measurements made on {HIV}-1 {TAR} at low salt concentrations, although not for different {TAR} mutants or at high salt concentrations. Our results confirm that topological constraints are an important determinant of bulge conformation and dynamics and demonstrate the utility of {TOPRNA} for studying the topological constraints of complex {RNAs}.},

	title = {The Role of Topological Constraints in {RNA} Tertiary Folding and Dynamics.},
	url = {https://core.ac.uk/display/73942220},
	abstract = {Functional {RNA} molecules must fold into highly complex three-dimensional (3D) structures and undergo precise structural dynamics in order to carry out their biological functions. However, the principles that govern {RNA} 3D folding and dynamics remain poorly understood. Recent studies have proposed that topological constraints arising from the basic connectivity and steric properties of {RNA} secondary structure strongly confine the 3D conformation of {RNA} junctions and thus may contribute to the specificity of {RNA} 3D folding and dynamics. Herein, this hypothesis is explored in quantitative detail using a combination of computational heuristic models and the specially developed coarse-grained molecular dynamics model {TOPRNA}. 
First, studies of two-way junctions provide new insight into the significance and mechanism of action of topological constraints. It is demonstrated that topological constraints explain the directionality and amplitude of bulge-induced bends, and that long-range tertiary interactions can modify topological constraints by disrupting non-canonical pairing in internal loops. Furthermore, topological constraints are shown to define free energy landscapes that coincide with the distribution of bulge conformations in structural databases and reproduce solution {NMR} measurements made on bulges.
Next, {TOPRNA} is used to investigate the contributions of topological constraints to {tRNA} folding and dynamics. Topological constraints strongly constrain {tRNA} 3D conformation and notably discriminate against formation of non-native tertiary contacts, providing a sequence-independent source of folding specificity. Furthermore, topological constraints are observed to give rise to thermodynamic cooperativity between distinct {tRNA} tertiary interactions and encode functionally important 3D dynamics. Mutant {tRNAs} with unnatural secondary structures are shown to lack these favorable characteristics, suggesting that topological constraints underlie the evolutionary conservation of {tRNA} secondary structure. Additional studies of a non-canonical mitochondrial {tRNA} show that increased topological constraints can reduce the entropic cost of tertiary folding, and that disruptions of topological constraints explain the pathogenicity of a insertion mutation in this {tRNA}. {UV} melting experiments verify these findings.
Finally, {TOPRNA} is used to study the topological constraints of the 197 nucleotide Azoarcus Group I ribozyme. It is shown that topological constraints strongly confine this {RNA} and provide a mechanism for encoding tertiary structure specificity and cooperative hierarchical folding behavior.{PhDBiophysicsUniversity} of Michigan, Horace H.

	abstract = {A ribonucleic acid ({RNA}) sequence is a word over an alphabet on four elements  called bases. {RNA} sequences fold into secondary structures where some bases pair with one another, while others remain unpaired. The two fundamental problems in {RNA} algorithmic are to predict how sequences fold within some models of energy and to design sequences of bases that will fold into targeted secondary structures. Predicting how a given {RNA} sequence folds into a pseudoknot-free secondary structure is known to be solvable in cubic time since the eighties and in truly subcubic time by a recent result of Bringmann et al. ({FOCS}, 2016), whereas Lyngsø has shown it is computationally hard if pseudoknots are allowed ({ICALP}, 2004). As a stark contrast, it is unknown whether or not designing a given {RNA} secondary structure is a tractable task; this has been raised as a challenging open question by Condon ({ICALP}, 2003). Because of its crucial importance in a number of fields such as pharmaceutical research and biochemistry, there are dozens of heuristics and software libraries dedicated to the {RNA} secondary structure design. It is therefore rather surprising that the computational complexity of this central problem in bioinformatics has been unsettled for decades. In this article, we show that in the simplest model of energy, which is the Watson–Crick model, the design of secondary structures is computationally hard if one adds natural constraints of the form: indexiof the sequence has to be labeled by baseb. This negative result suggests that the same lower bound holds for more realistic models of energy. It is noteworthy that the additional constraints are by no means artificial: they are provided by all the {RNA} design pieces of software and they do correspond to the actual practice (e.g., the instances of the {EteRNA} project).},

Results in the literature rely on a wide variety of design criteria adapted to the particular requirements of each application. Using an extensively studied thermodynamic model, we perform a detailed study of several criteria for designing sequences intended to adopt a target secondary structure. We conclude that superior design methods should explicitly implement both a positive design paradigm (optimize affinity for the target structure) and a negative design paradigm (optimize specificity for the target structure). The commonly used approaches of sequence symmetry minimization and minimum free-energy satisfaction primarily implement negative design and can be strengthened by introducing a positive design component. Surprisingly, our findings hold for a wide range of secondary structures and are robust to modest perturbation of the thermodynamic parameters used for evaluating sequence quality, suggesting the feasibility and ongoing utility of a unified approach to nucleic acid design as parameter sets are refined further. Finally, we observe that designing for thermodynamic stability does not determine folding kinetics, emphasizing the opportunity for extending design criteria to target kinetic features of the energy landscape.},

	abstract = {The evolution and adaptation of molecular populations is constrained by the diversity accessible through mutational processes. {RNA} is a paradigmatic example of biopolymer where genotype (sequence) and phenotype (approximated by the secondary structure fold) are identified in a single molecule. The extreme redundancy of the genotype-phenotype map leads to large ensembles of {RNA} sequences that fold into the same secondary structure and can be connected through single-point mutations. These ensembles define neutral networks of phenotypes in sequence space. Here we analyze the topological properties of neutral networks formed by 12-nucleotides {RNA} sequences, obtained through the exhaustive folding of sequence space. A total of 4(12) sequences fragments into 645 subnetworks that correspond to 57 different secondary structures. The topological analysis reveals that each subnetwork is far from being random: it has a degree distribution with a well-defined average and a small dispersion, a high clustering coefficient, and an average shortest path between nodes close to its minimum possible value, i.e. the Hamming distance between sequences. {RNA} neutral networks are assortative due to the correlation in the composition of neighboring sequences, a feature that together with the symmetries inherent to the folding process explains the existence of communities. Several topological relationships can be analytically derived attending to structural restrictions and generic properties of the folding process. The average degree of these phenotypic networks grows logarithmically with their size, such that abundant phenotypes have the additional advantage of being more robust to mutations. This property prevents fragmentation of neutral networks and thus enhances the navigability of sequence space. In summary, {RNA} neutral networks show unique topological properties, unknown to other networks previously described.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of neutral mutations implies that biological systems typically have many more genotypes than phenotypes. But, can the way that genotypes are distributed over phenotypes determine evolutionary outcomes? Answering such questions is difficult, in part because the number of genotypes can be hyper-astronomically large. By solving the genotype–phenotype ({GP}) map for {RNA} secondary structure ({SS}) for systems up to length L = 126 nucleotides (where the set of all possible {RNA} strands would weigh more than the mass of the visible universe), we show that the {GP} map strongly constrains the evolution of non-coding {RNA} ({ncRNA}). Simple random sampling over genotypes predicts the distribution of properties such as the mutational robustness or the number of stems per {SS} found in naturally occurring {ncRNA} with surprising accuracy. Because we ignore natural selection, this strikingly close correspondence with the mapping suggests that structures allowing for functionality are easily discovered, despite the enormous size of the genetic spaces. The mapping is extremely biased: the majority of genotypes map to an exponentially small portion of the morphospace of all biophysically possible structures. Such strong constraints provide a non-adaptive explanation for the convergent evolution of structures such as the hammerhead ribozyme. These results present a particularly clear example of bias in the arrival of variation strongly shaping evolutionary outcomes and may be relevant to Mayr's distinction between proximate and ultimate causes in evolutionary biology.},

Thus, {toyLIFE} shows a high degeneracy in the mapping from genotypes to phenotypes, as well as a highly skewed distribution of phenotypic abundances. The neutral networks associated with abundant phenotypes are highly navigable, and common phenotypes are close to each other in genotype space. All of these properties are remarkable, as {toyLIFE} is built on a version of the {HP} protein-folding model that is neither robust nor evolvable: phenotypes cannot be mutually accessed through point mutations. In addition, both robustness and evolvability increase with the number of genes in a genotype.

	abstract = {The Kinfold and {KFOLD} programs for {RNA} folding kinetics implement the Gillespie algorithm to generate stochastic folding trajectories from an initial structure s to a target structure t, in which each intermediate secondary structure is obtained from its predecessor by the addition, removal or shift of a single base pair. Define {MS}2 distance between secondary structures s and t to be the minimum path length to refold s to t, where a move from {MS}2 is applied in each step. We describe algorithms to compute the shortest {MS}2 folding trajectory between any two given {RNA} secondary structures. These algorithms include an optimal integer programming ({IP}) algorithm, an accurate and efficient near-optimal algorithm, a greedy algorithm, a branch-and-bound algorithm, and an optimal algorithm if one allows intermediate structures to contain pseudoknots. Our optimal {IP} [resp. near-optimal {IP}] algorithm maximizes [resp. approximately maximizes] the number of shifts and minimizes [resp. approximately minimizes] the number of base pair additions and removals by applying integer programming to (essentially) solve the minimum feedback vertex set ({FVS}) problem for the {RNA} conflict digraph, then applies topological sort to tether subtrajectories into the final optimal folding trajectory. We prove {NP}-hardness of the problem to determine the minimum barrier energy over all possible {MS}2 folding pathways, and conjecture that computing the {MS}2 distance between arbitrary secondary structures is {NP}-hard. Since our optimal {IP} algorithm relies on the {FVS}, known to be {NP}-complete for arbitrary digraphs, we compare the family of {RNA} conflict digraphs with the following classes of digraphs (planar, reducible flow graph, Eulerian, and tournament) for which {FVS} is known to be either polynomial time computable or {NP}-hard.

In the same fashion as the {KINFOLD} algorithm, which also uses the Gillespie algorithm to predict folding kinetics, {KFOLD} stochastically chooses a new {RNA} secondary structure state that is accessible from the current state by a single base-pair addition/deletion following the Gillespie procedure. However, unlike {KINFOLD}, the {KFOLD} algorithm utilizes the fact that many of the base-pair addition/deletion reactions and their corresponding rates do not change between each step in the algorithm. This allows {KFOLD} to achieve a substantial speed-up in the time required to compute a prediction of the folding pathway and, for a fixed number of base-pair moves, performs logarithmically with sequence size. This increase in speed opens up the possibility of studying the kinetics of much longer {RNA} sequences at single base-pair resolution while also allowing for the {RNA} folding statistics of smaller {RNA} sequences to be computed much more quickly.},

	abstract = {{RNA} inverse folding is a computational technology for designing {RNA} sequences which fold into a user-specified secondary structure. Although pseudoknots are functionally important motifs in {RNA} structures, less reports concerning the inverse folding of pseudoknotted {RNAs} have been done compared to those for pseudoknot-free {RNA} design. In this paper, we present a new version of our multi-objective genetic algorithm ({MOGA}), {MODENA}, which we have previously proposed for pseudoknot-free {RNA} inverse folding. In the new version of {MODENA}, (i) a new crossover operator is implemented and (ii) pseudoknot prediction methods, {IPknot} and {HotKnots}, are used to evaluate the designed {RNA} sequences, allowing us to perform the inverse folding of pseudoknotted {RNAs}. The new version of {MODENA} with the new crossover operator was benchmarked with a dataset composed of natural pseudoknotted {RNA} secondary structures, and we found that {MODENA} can successfully design more pseudoknotted {RNAs} compared to the other pseudoknot design algorithm. In addition, a sequence constraint function newly implemented in the new version of {MODENA} was tested by designing {RNA} sequences which fold into the pseudoknotted structure of a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme; as a result, we successfully designed eight {RNA} sequences. The new version of {MODENA} is downloadable from http://rna.eit.hirosaki-u.ac.jp/modena/.},

	abstract = {The use of free energy-based algorithms to compute {RNA} secondary structures produces, in general, large numbers of foldings. Recent research has addressed the problem of grouping structures into a small number of clusters and computing a representative folding for each cluster. At the heart of this problem is the need to compute a quantity that measures the difference between pairs of foldings. We introduce a new concept, the relaxed base-pair ({RBP}) score, designed to give a more biologically realistic measure of the difference between structures than the base-pair ({BP}) metric, which simply counts the number of base pairs in one structure but not the other. The degree of relaxation is determined by a single relaxation parameter, t. When t = 0, (no relaxation) our method is the same as the {BP} metric. At the other extreme, a very large value of t will give a distance of 0 for identical structures and 1 for structures that differ. Scores can be recomputed with different values of t, at virtually no extra computation cost, to yield satisfactory results. Our results indicate that relaxed measures give more stable and more meaningful clusters than the {BP} metric. We also use the {RBP} score to compute representative foldings for each cluster.},

{RESULTS}: Here we show a one-to-one correspondence between that algorithm and a formal transformational grammar. This grammar class encompasses the context-free grammars and goes beyond to generate pseudoknotted structures. The pseudoknot grammar avoids the use of general context-sensitive rules by introducing a small number of auxiliary symbols used to reorder the strings generated by an otherwise context-free grammar. This formal representation of the residue correlations in {RNA} structure is important because it means we can build full probabilistic models of {RNA} secondary structure, including pseudoknots, and use them to optimally parse sequences in polynomial time.},

One of the foremost objective of {RNA} design is that the designed {RNA} sequence should adopt a predefined target secondary structure preferentially to any alternative structure, according to a given metrics and folding model. It was observed in several works that some secondary structures are undesignable, i.e. no {RNA} sequence can fold into the target structure while satisfying some criterion measuring how preferential this folding is compared to alternative conformations. In this paper, we show that the proportion of designable secondary structures decreases exponentially with the size of the target secondary structure, for various popular combinations of energy models and design objectives. This exponential decay is, at least in part, due to the existence of undesignable motifs, which can be generically constructed, and jointly analyzed to yield asymptotic upper-bounds on the number of designable structures.},

Pseudoknots occur relatively rarely in {RNA} but are highly overrepresented in functionally critical motifs in large catalytic {RNAs}, in riboswitches, and in regulatory elements of viruses. Pseudoknots are usually excluded from {RNA} structure prediction algorithms. When included, these pairings are difficult to model accurately, especially in large {RNAs}, because allowing this structure dramatically increases the number of possible incorrect folds and because it is difficult to search the fold space for an optimal structure. We have developed a concise secondary structure modeling approach that combines {SHAPE} (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) experimental chemical probing information and a simple, but robust, energy model for the entropic cost of single pseudoknot formation. Structures are predicted with iterative refinement, using a dynamic programming algorithm. This melded experimental and thermodynamic energy function predicted the secondary structures and the pseudoknots for a set of 21 challenging {RNAs} of known structure ranging in size from 34 to 530 nt. On average, 93\% of known base pairs were predicted, and all pseudoknots in well-folded {RNAs} were identified.},

	abstract = {{RNA} {SHAPE} experiments have become important and successful sources of information for {RNA} structure prediction. In such experiments, chemical reagents are used to probe {RNA} backbone flexibility at the nucleotide level, which in turn provides information on base pairing and therefore secondary structure. Little is known, however, about the statistics of such {SHAPE} data. In this work, we explore different representations of noise in {SHAPE} data and propose a statistically sound framework for extracting reliable reactivity information from multiple {SHAPE} replicates. Our analyses of {RNA} {SHAPE} experiments underscore that a normal noise model is not adequate to represent their data. We propose instead a log-normal representation of noise and discuss its relevance. Under this assumption, we observe that processing simulated {SHAPE} data by directly averaging different replicates leads to bias. Such bias can be reduced by analyzing the data following a log transformation, either by log-averaging or Kalman filtering. Application of Kalman filtering has the additional advantage that a prior on the nucleotide reactivities can be introduced. We show that the performance of Kalman filtering is then directly dependent on the quality of that prior. We conclude the paper with guidelines on signal processing of {RNA} {SHAPE} data.},

Since prediction algorithms rely on thermodynamic energy models to identify low-energy structures, prediction accuracy relies in large part on the quality of free energy change parameters. In this work, we use our earlier constraint generation and Boltzmann likelihood parameter estimation methods to obtain new energy parameters for two energy models for secondary structures with pseudoknots, namely, the Dirks–Pierce ({DP}) and the Cao–Chen ({CC}) models. To train our parameters, and also to test their accuracy, we create a large data set of both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free secondary structures. In addition to structural data our training data set also includes thermodynamic data, for which experimentally determined free energy changes are available for sequences and their reference structures. When incorporated into the {HotKnots} prediction algorithm, our new parameters result in significantly improved secondary structure prediction on our test data set. Specifically, the prediction accuracy when using our new parameters improves from 68\% to 79\% for the {DP} model, and from 70\% to 77\% for the {CC} model.},

Using simulated (the \textit{{NK}} model) and empirical sequence landscapes, we define four key performance metrics: interpolation within the training domain, extrapolation outside the training domain, robustness to sparse training data, and ability to cope with epistasis/ruggedness. We show that architectural differences between algorithms consistently affect performance against these metrics across both experimental and theoretical landscapes. Moreover, landscape ruggedness is revealed to be the greatest determinant of the accuracy of sequence-fitness prediction. We hope that this benchmarking method and the code that accompanies it will enable robust evaluation and comparison of novel architectures in this emerging field and assist in the adoption of {ML} for protein engineering.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Comparative sequence analysis has placed this intron and the Anabaena pre-{tRNA}(Leu) intron into the same subgroup, {IC}3; we now compare their activity and stability. Unlike the Anabaena intron, the Azoarcus intron has two transitions in the kinetics of the first step of splicing. The faster transition occurs with a larger k(cat)/K(m) than that of the Anabaena or other group I introns, due to a rapid K(cat) (5 min(-1) at 32 degrees C) and a low K(m) for guanosine (17 {microM}). The excised intron circularizes by releasing a trinucleotide from the 5' end of the intron, another property unlike the Anabaena intron. Although it is smaller in size, the Azoarcus intron retains activity at higher temperatures, higher concentrations of urea, and higher {pH} than the Anabaena intron. Melting curves show that tertiary structure is disrupted at a lower temperature in the Anabaena intron. Some structural features that may explain the unusual stability of the Azoarcus intron include a G-C rich secondary structure and the presence of two 11-nt motifs, which are known to interact strongly with {GAAA} loops in group I and group {II} introns. The disruption of one of these interactions by substituting the Anabaena structural element in fact lowered the thermal stability of the Azoarcus intron. Thus, even superficially similar group I introns from the same structural subgroup can differ significantly in activity and stability.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-018-2007-7},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {RNA} structure prediction is an important field in bioinformatics, and numerous methods and tools have been proposed. Pseudoknots are specific motifs of {RNA} secondary structures that are difficult to predict. Almost all existing methods are based on a single model and return one solution, often missing the real structure. An alternative approach would be to combine different models and return a (small) set of solutions, maximizing its quality and diversity in order to increase the probability that it contains the real structure.
{RESULTS}: We propose here an original method for predicting {RNA} secondary structures with pseudoknots, based on integer programming. We developed a generic bi-objective integer programming algorithm allowing to return optimal and sub-optimal solutions optimizing simultaneously two models. This algorithm was then applied to the combination of two known models of {RNA} secondary structure prediction, namely {MEA} and {MFE}. The resulting tool, called {BiokoP}, is compared with the other methods in the literature. The results show that the best solution (structure with the highest F1-score) is, in most cases, given by {BiokoP}. Moreover, the results of {BiokoP} are homogeneous, regardless of the pseudoknot type or the presence or not of pseudoknots. Indeed, the F1-scores are always higher than 70\% for any number of solutions returned.
{CONCLUSION}: The results obtained by {BiokoP} show that combining the {MEA} and the {MFE} models, as well as returning several optimal and several sub-optimal solutions, allow to improve the prediction of secondary structures. One perspective of our work is to combine better mono-criterion models, in particular to combine a model based on the comparative approach with the {MEA} and the {MFE} models. This leads to develop in the future a new multi-objective algorithm to combine more than two models. {BiokoP} is available on the {EvryRNA} platform: https://{EvryRNA}.ibisc.univ-evry.fr .},

	shorttitle = {Lost in folding space?},
	abstract = {Background
Many bioinformatics tools for {RNA} secondary structure analysis are based on a thermodynamic model of {RNA} folding. They predict a single, "optimal" structure by free energy minimization, they enumerate near-optimal structures, they compute base pair probabilities and dot plots, representative structures of different abstract shapes, or Boltzmann probabilities of structures and shapes. Although all programs refer to the same physical model, they implement it with considerable variation for different tasks, and little is known about the effects of heuristic assumptions and model simplifications used by the programs on the outcome of the analysis.

Results
We extract four different models of the thermodynamic folding space which underlie the programs {RNAFOLD}, {RNASHAPES}, and {RNASUBOPT}. Their differences lie within the details of the energy model and the granularity of the folding space. We implement probabilistic shape analysis for all models, and introduce the shape probability shift as a robust measure of model similarity. Using four data sets derived from experimentally solved structures, we provide a quantitative evaluation of the model differences.

Conclusions
We find that search space granularity affects the computed shape probabilities less than the over- or underapproximation of free energy by a simplified energy model. Still, the approximations perform similar enough to implementations of the full model to justify their continued use in settings where computational constraints call for simpler algorithms. On the side, we observe that the rarely used level 2 shapes, which predict the complete arrangement of helices, multiloops, internal loops and bulges, include the "true" shape in a rather small number of predicted high probability shapes. This calls for an investigation of new strategies to extract high probability members from the (very large) level 2 shape space of an {RNA} sequence. We provide implementations of all four models, written in a declarative style that makes them easy to be modified. Based on our study, future work on thermodynamic {RNA} folding may make a choice of model based on our empirical data. It can take our implementations as a starting point for further program development.},

	abstract = {Many systems across the sciences evolve through a combination of multiplicative growth and diffusive transport. In the presence of disorder, these systems tend to form localized structures which alternate between long periods of relative stasis and short bursts of activity. This behaviour, known as intermittency in physics and punctuated equilibrium in evolutionary theory, is difficult to forecast; in particular there is no general principle to locate the regions where the system will settle, how long it will stay there, or where it will jump next. Here I introduce a predictive theory of linear intermittency that closes these gaps. I show that any positive linear system can be mapped onto a generalization of the "maximal entropy random walk", a Markov process on graphs with non-local transition rates. This construction reveals the localization islands as local minima of an effective potential, and intermittent jumps as barrier crossings in that potential. My results unify the concepts of intermittency in linear systems and Markovian metastability, and provide a generally applicable method to reduce, and predict, the dynamics of disordered linear systems. Applications span physics, evolutionary dynamics and epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Growing efforts to measure fitness landscapes in molecular and microbial systems are premised on a tight relationship between landscape topography and evolutionary trajectories. This relationship, however, is far from being straightforward: depending on their mutation rate, Darwinian populations can climb the closest fitness peak (survival of the fittest), settle in lower regions with higher mutational robustness (survival of the flattest), or fail to adapt altogether (error catastrophes). These bifurcations highlight that evolution does not necessarily drive populations "from lower peak to higher peak", as Wright imagined. The problem therefore remains: how exactly does a complex landscape topography constrain evolution, and can we predict where it will go next? Here I introduce a generalization of quasispecies theory which identifies metastable evolutionary states as minima of an effective potential. From this representation I derive a coarse-grained, Markov state model of evolution, which in turn forms a basis for evolutionary predictions across a wide range of mutation rates. Because the effective potential is related to the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian, my approach could stimulate fruitful interactions between evolutionary dynamics and quantum many-body theory},

	abstract = {{RNA} pseudoknots are functional structure elements with key roles in viral and cellular processes. Prediction of a pseudoknotted minimum free energy structure is an {NP}-complete problem. Practical algorithms for {RNA} structure prediction including restricted classes of pseudoknots suffer from high runtime and poor accuracy for longer sequences. A heuristic approach is to search for promising pseudoknot candidates in a sequence and verify those. Afterwards, the detected pseudoknots can be further analysed using bioinformatics or laboratory techniques. We present a novel pseudoknot detection method called {DotKnot} that extracts stem regions from the secondary structure probability dot plot and assembles pseudoknot candidates in a constructive fashion. We evaluate pseudoknot free energies using novel parameters, which have recently become available. We show that the conventional probability dot plot makes a wide class of pseudoknots including those with bulged stems manageable in an explicit fashion. The energy parameters now become the limiting factor in pseudoknot prediction. {DotKnot} is an efficient method for long sequences, which finds pseudoknots with higher accuracy compared to other known prediction algorithms. {DotKnot} is accessible as a web server at http://dotknot.csse.uwa.edu.au.},

For example, the average positive predictive value, 65.8\%, is increased to 91.0\% when only base pairs with probability of 0.99 or above are considered. The quality of base pair predictions can also be increased by the addition of experimentally determined constraints, including enzymatic cleavage, flavin mono-nucleotide cleavage, and chemical modification. Predicted secondary structures can be color annotated to demonstrate pairs with high probability that are therefore well determined as compared to base pairs with lower probability of pairing.},

	abstract = {A novel approach aiding in the prediction of {RNA} secondary structures is presented. Although phylogenetic methods are the most successful at deriving {RNA} secondary structures, the are not applicable when the number of sequences or the sequence variability is too low. Methods based on energy minimization are therefore of great interest. However, some of the suboptimal {RNA} secondary structures computed with classic methods are unsaturated structures, i.e. some structures are included into others. Thus, the incorporation of constraints during the process of folding is not possible, while the incorporation of constraints before the process of folding often introduces a bias into the energy function. This paper describes a new procedure which allows for the incorporation of constraints before and during the process of {RNA} folding. {SAPSSARN} is an interactive program which offers a framework, both to specify a secondary structure through a set of folding constraints and to compute all the supoptimal saturated {RNA} secondary structures which satisfy all the folding constraints. At the start, it relies on the computation of the probabilities of pairing of each base with all others according to {McCaskill}'s algorithm. The constraint satisfaction formulation of the problem deals dynamically with a chosen set of folding constraints and, finally, a search algorithm computes all the suboptimal saturated secondary structures which satisfy those folding constraints. Within such a framework, it is possible to test new ideas about {RNA} folding and secondary structures, including pseudoknots, can be computed. The program is illustrated with {RNA} sequences on which we obtained results in agreement with known structures by using a protocol which mimics the hierarchical folding of {RNA} molecules.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btg373},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Pseudoknots have generally been excluded from the prediction of {RNA} secondary structures due to its difficulty in modeling. Although, several dynamic programming algorithms exist for the prediction of pseudoknots using thermodynamic approaches, they are neither reliable nor efficient. On the other hand, comparative methods are more reliable, but are often done in an ad hoc manner and require expert intervention. Maximum weighted matching, an algorithm for pseudoknot prediction with comparative analysis, suffers from low-prediction accuracy in many cases.
{RESULTS}: Here we present an algorithm, iterated loop matching, for reliably and efficiently predicting {RNA} secondary structures including pseudoknots. The method can utilize either thermodynamic or comparative information or both, thus is able to predict pseudoknots for both aligned and individual sequences. We have tested the algorithm on a number of {RNA} families. Using 8-12 homologous sequences, the algorithm correctly identifies more than 90\% of base-pairs for short sequences and 80\% overall. It correctly predicts nearly all pseudoknots and produces very few spurious base-pairs for sequences without pseudoknots. Comparisons show that our algorithm is both more sensitive and more specific than the maximum weighted matching method. In addition, our algorithm has high-prediction accuracy on individual sequences, comparable with the {PKNOTS} algorithm, while using much less computational resources.

In many cases, non-coding {RNAs} exert their function by binding to other nucleic acids, as in the case of {microRNAs} and {snoRNAs}. The specificity of these interactions derives from the stability of inter-molecular base pairing. The accurate computational treatment of {RNA}-{RNA} binding therefore lies at the heart of target prediction algorithms.
{METHODS}: The standard dynamic programming algorithms for computing secondary structures of linear single-stranded {RNA} molecules are extended to the co-folding of two interacting {RNAs}.
{RESULTS}: We present a program, {RNAcofold}, that computes the hybridization energy and base pairing pattern of a pair of interacting {RNA} molecules. In contrast to earlier approaches, complex internal structures in both {RNAs} are fully taken into account. {RNAcofold} supports the calculation of the minimum energy structure and of a complete set of suboptimal structures in an energy band above the ground state. Furthermore, it provides an extension of {McCaskill}'s partition function algorithm to compute base pairing probabilities, realistic interaction energies, and equilibrium concentrations of duplex structures.},

Structural topologies such as pseudoknots are of particular interest due to their ubiquity and direct involvement in {RNA} function, but identifying pseudoknots is a computationally challenging problem and existing heuristic approaches usually perform poorly for {RNA} sequences of even a few hundred bases. We survey the performance of pseudoknot prediction methods on a data set of full-length {RNA} sequences representing varied sequence lengths, and biological {RNA} classes such as {RNase} P {RNA}, Group I Intron, {tmRNA} and {tRNA}. Pseudoknot prediction methods are compared with minimum free energy and suboptimal secondary structure prediction methods in terms of correct base-pairs, stems and pseudoknots and we find that the ensemble of suboptimal structure predictions succeeds in identifying correct structural elements in {RNA} that are usually missed in {MFE} and pseudoknot predictions. We propose a strategy to identify a comprehensive set of non-redundant stems in the suboptimal structure space of a {RNA} molecule by applying heuristics that reduce the structural redundancy of the predicted suboptimal structures by merging slightly varying stems that are predicted to form in local sequence regions. This reduced-redundancy set of structural elements consistently outperforms more specialized approaches.in data sets. Thus, the suboptimal folding space can be used to represent the structural diversity of an {RNA} molecule more comprehensively than optimal structure prediction approaches alone.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schrödinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction ({FCI}) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods—a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies.

Furthermore, secondary structures are often evolutionarily well conserved, evolving much slower than the underlying sequences. From a bioinformatics perspective, {RNAsecondary} structures are a convenient representation because efficient exact algorithms are known to enumerate the structures that can be formed by a given sequence, to solve the folding problem, and to compute the partition function (and hence any thermodynamic quantity of interest) from a well-measured set of empirical energy parameters.},

The notion of a "landscape"  2 C. Flamm, I.L. Hofacker, P.F. Stadler  underlies both the structure formation (folding) and the (in vitro) evolution  of {RNA}.  Evolutionary adaptation may be seen as hill climbing process on a fitness  landscape which is determined by the phenotype of the {RNA} molecule (within  the model this is its secondary structure) and the selection constraints acting  on the molecules. We find that a substantial fraction of point mutations do not  change an {RNA} secondary structure. On the other hand, a comparable fraction  of mutations leads to very different structures.

	abstract = {{RNA}-Molekule falten auf sich selbst zuruck durch Interaktion komplementarer Segmente der linearen Sequenz. Dieser Prozess, der zu der biologisch funktionellen Form eines {RNA}-Molekuls fuhrt, wird als \&quot;Faltung\&quot; bezeichnet. Die dabei gebildete Sekundarstruktur umfasst den grosten Teil der freie Energie und kann formal durch eine Menge von Basenpaaren beschrieben werden. 
 
Bestehende Berechnungsmethoden erlauben relativ genaue Vorhersagen von Grundzustanden, Basenpaarungswahrscheinlichkeiten und anderen thermodynamischen Eigenschaften von {RNA} Sekundarstrukturen. Diese Algorithmen basieren auf experimentell bestimmten Enthalpie- und Entropieparametern. 
 
Neben den Grundzustand kann eine {RNA} eine Vielzahl verschiedener Strukturen annehmen, welche gemeinsam eine Ensemble verschiedenster Konformationen darstellen. Durch die Einfuhrung des Begriffs der \&quot;strukturellen Nachbarschaft\&quot; bildet dieses Ensemble, zusammen mit der freien Energien seiner Elemente, eine Energielandschaft. Diese Konzepte erlauben nun, Faltungs- und Umfaltungsdynamiken von {RNAs} zu untersuchen. Biologische Phanomene, wie die Regulation der Genexpression durch {RNA}-Schalter, prokaryotische Attenuatoren oder strukturelle Veranderungen der genomischen {RNA} von Viroiden und {RNA}-Viren erfordern detailiertes Verstandnis von Umfaltungspfaden und deren Kinetik. 
 
In meiner Doktorarbeit prasentiere ich neue heuristische Algorithmen basierend auf einer abstrakten Darstellung der Energielandschaft mittels Distanzklassenpartitionierung, um optimale Faltungspfade und Faltungsverhalten vorherzusagen. Groser Wert wird hierbei darauf gelegt, diese Algorithmen auf {RNA}-Molekule von biologisch signifikanter Sequenzlange anwenden zu konnen. Durch Untersuchung variabler und statischer Energielandschaften mittels stochastischer und deterministischer Methoden konnen diese neuen Ansatze auch zur Vorhersage co-transkriptioneller Faltungskinetiken verwendet werden. 
 
Daruber hinaus wurde eine Erweiterung vorhandener Methoden zur {RNA}-{RNAInteraktionsvorhersage} entwickelt, sodas diese auch auf {RNA}/{DNA} Heterodimere, die beispielsweise wahrend des Transkriptionsprozesses auftreten, angewandt werden konnen. Um effiziente und genaue Rahmenbedingungen fur alle meine Sekundarstrukturanalysen zu schaffen, implementierte ich die neuesten thermodynamischen Energiemodelle in das {ViennaRNA} Package. Weiters wurden G-Quadruplexe in mehrere Programme des {ViennaRNA} Package eingefuhrt und bilden somit das erste Strukturmotiv, das uber die klassischen Sekundarstrukturen hinausgeht. 
 
Diese neuen Verfahren konnen helfen, die Beziehung zwischen Strukturmerkmalen der Energielandschaft und ihren Einflus auf Faltungskinetik von {RNA}-Molekulen besser zu verstehen. Weiters konnten dadurch neue Wege in Richtung in silico Design von {RNAs} mit bestimmten Faltungsverhalten eroffnet werden und somit in stark interdisziplinaren Bereichen wie der Synthetischen Biologie Anwendung finden.},

	abstract = {The current implementation of the Neo-Darwinian model of evolution typically assumes that the set of possible phenotypes is organized into a highly symmetric and regular space. Most conveniently, a Euclidean vector space is used, representing phenotypic properties by real-valued variables. Computational work on the biophysical genotype-phenotype model of {RNA} folding, however, suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and can be formalized only in terms of a relatively unfamiliar structure. Patterns of phenotypic evolution—such as punctuation, irreversibility, and modularity—result naturally from the properties of the genotype-phenotype map, which, given the genetic accessibility structure, define accessibility in the phenotype space. The classical framework, however, addresses these patterns exclusively in terms of natural selection on suitably constructed fitness landscapes. Recent work has extended the explanatory level for phenotypic evolution from fitness considerations alone to include the topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the genotype-phenotype map. Lewontin’s notion of “quasi-independence” of characters can also be formalized in topological terms: it corresponds to the assumption that a region of the phenotype space is represented by a product space of orthogonal factors. In this picture, each character corresponds to a factor of a region of the phenotype space. We consider any region of the phenotype space that has a given factorization as a “type”, i.e., as a set of phenotypes that share the same set of phenotypic characters. Thus, a theory of character identity can be developed that is based on the correspondence of local factors in different regions of the phenotype space.},

	abstract = {Can linear systems be solved faster than matrix multiplication? While there has been remarkable progress for the special cases of graph structured linear systems, in the general setting, the bit complexity of solving an \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$ linear system \$Ax=b\$ is \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(n{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}omega)\$, where \${\textbackslash}omega {\textless} 2.372864\$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Improving on this has been an open problem even for sparse linear systems with poly\$(n)\$ condition number. In this paper, we present an algorithm that solves linear systems in sparse matrices asymptotically faster than matrix multiplication for any \${\textbackslash}omega {\textgreater} 2\$. This speedup holds for any input matrix \$A\$ with \$o(n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}omega -1\}/{\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}kappa(A)))\$ non-zeros, where \${\textbackslash}kappa(A)\$ is the condition number of \$A\$. For poly\$(n)\$-conditioned matrices with \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(n)\$ nonzeros, and the current value of \${\textbackslash}omega\$, the bit complexity of our algorithm to solve to within any \$1/{\textbackslash}text\{poly\}(n)\$ error is \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{2.331645\})\$. Our algorithm can be viewed as an efficient, randomized implementation of the block Krylov method via recursive low displacement rank factorizations. It is inspired by the algorithm of [Eberly et al. {ISSAC} `06 `07] for inverting matrices over finite fields. In our analysis of numerical stability, we develop matrix anti-concentration techniques to bound the smallest eigenvalue and the smallest gap in eigenvalues of semi-random matrices.},

Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis of {RNA} splicing were used to identify a base triple in the conserved core of both a cyanobacterial (Anabaena) and a eukaryotic (Tetrahymena) group I intron. This long-range interaction connects a sequence adjacent to the guanosine-binding site with the domain implicated in coordinating the 5′ splice site helix, and it thereby contributes to formation of the active site.

The temperature dependence of the partition function gives information about melting behavior for the secondary structure. The pair binding probabilities, the computation of which depends on the partition function, are visually summarized in a “box matrix” display and this provides a useful tool for examining the full ensemble of probable alternative equilibrium structures. The calculation of this ensemble representation allows a proper application and assessment of the predictive power of the secondary structure method, and yields important information on alternatives and intermediates in addition to local information about base pair opening and slippage. The results are illustrated for representative {tRNA}, 5S {RNA}, and self-replicating and self-splicing {RNA} molecules, and allow a direct comparison with enzymatic structure probes. The effect of changes in the thermodynamic parameters on the equilibrium ensemble provides a further sensitivity check to the predictions.},

But the most fundamental questions, from the perspective of philosophy of science, remain open: To what discipline(s) does the {FEP} belong? Does it make falsifiable claims? What sort of scientific object is it? Is it to be taken as a representation of contingent states of affairs in nature? Does it constitute knowledge? What role is it in- tended to play in relation to empirical research? Does the {FEP} even properly belong to the domain of science? To the extent that it has engaged with them at all, the extant literature has begged, dodged, dismissed, and skirted around these questions, without ever addressing them head-on. These questions must, I urge, be answered satisfactorily before we can make any headway on the philosophical consequences of the {FEP}. I take preliminary steps towards answering these questions in this paper, first by examining closely key formal elements of the framework and the implications they hold for its utility, and second, by highlighting potential modes of interpreting the {FEP} in light of an abundant philosophical literature on scientific modelling.},

	abstract = {{RNA} pseudoknots are an important structural feature of {RNAs}, but often neglected in computer predictions for reasons of efficiency. Here, we present the {pknotsRG} Web Server for single sequence {RNA} secondary structure prediction including pseudoknots. {pknotsRG} employs the newest Turner energy rules for finding the structure of minimal free energy. The algorithm has been improved in several ways recently. First, it has been reimplemented in the C programming language, resulting in a 60-fold increase in speed. Second, all suboptimal foldings up to a user-defined threshold can be enumerated. For large scale analysis, a fast sliding window mode is available. Further improvements of the Web Server are a new output visualization using the {PseudoViewer} Web Service or {RNAmovies} for a movie like animation of several suboptimal foldings.The tool is available as source code, binary executable, online tool or as Web Service. The latter alternative allows for an easy integration into bio-informatics pipelines. {pknotsRG} is available at the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg).},

One of the main reasons for the late recognition of umami taste is the difference in culinary culture between Europe and Japan. Recent collaborative studies with chefs and researchers on traditional soup stocks showed different taste profiles for the Japanese soup stock ‘dashi’ and the western-style soup stock. The profile of free amino acids in dashi, when compared to the one in the Western style soup stock, explains why umami has been more easily accepted by Japanese who have being traditionally experiencing the simple umami taste of dashi. The recent exchange on cooking methods and diverse types of umami-rich foods in different countries has facilitated a new approach to culinary science blending culinary arts, food science, and food technology for healthier and tastier solutions.},

	abstract = {We describe an algorithm for designing the sequence of one or more interacting nucleic acid strands intended to adopt a target secondary structure at equilibrium. Sequence design is formulated as an optimization problem with the goal of reducing the ensemble defect below a user-specified stop condition. For a candidate sequence and a given target secondary structure, the ensemble defect is the average number of incorrectly paired nucleotides at equilibrium evaluated over the ensemble of unpseudoknotted secondary structures. To reduce the computational cost of accepting or rejecting mutations to a random initial sequence, candidate mutations are evaluated on the leaf nodes of a tree-decomposition of the target structure. During leaf optimization, defect-weighted mutation sampling is used to select each candidate mutation position with probability proportional to its contribution to the ensemble defect of the leaf. As subsequences are merged moving up the tree, emergent structural defects resulting from crosstalk between sibling sequences are eliminated via reoptimization within the defective subtree starting from new random subsequences. Using a Θ(N3) dynamic program to evaluate the ensemble defect of a target structure with N nucleotides, this hierarchical approach implies an asymptotic optimality bound on design time: for sufficiently large N, the cost of sequence design is bounded below by 4/3 the cost of a single evaluation of the ensemble defect for the full sequence. Hence, the design algorithm has time complexity Ω(N3). For target structures containing N ∈100,200,400,800,1600,3200 nucleotides and duplex stems ranging from 1 to 30 base pairs, {RNA} sequence designs at 37°C typically succeed in satisfying a stop condition with ensemble defect less than N/100. Empirically, the sequence design algorithm exhibits asymptotic optimality and the exponent in the time complexity bound is sharp. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2011},

	abstract = {Motivation: Recent transcriptomic studies have revealed the existence of a considerable number of non-protein-coding {RNA} transcripts in higher eukaryotic cells. To investigate the functional roles of these transcripts, it is of great interest to find conserved secondary structures from multiple alignments on a genomic scale. Since multiple alignments are often created using alignment programs that neglect the special conservation patterns of {RNA} secondary structures for computational efficiency, alignment failures can cause potential risks of overlooking conserved stem structures.Results: We investigated the dependence of the accuracy of secondary structure prediction on the quality of alignments. We compared three algorithms that maximize the expected accuracy of secondary structures as well as other frequently used algorithms. We found that one of our algorithms, called {McCaskill}-{MEA}, was more robust against alignment failures than others. The {McCaskill}-{MEA} method first computes the base pairing probability matrices for all the sequences in the alignment and then obtains the base pairing probability matrix of the alignment by averaging over these matrices. The consensus secondary structure is predicted from this matrix such that the expected accuracy of the prediction is maximized. We show that the {McCaskill}-{MEA} method performs better than other methods, particularly when the alignment quality is low and when the alignment consists of many sequences. Our model has a parameter that controls the sensitivity and specificity of predictions. We discussed the uses of that parameter for multi-step screening procedures to search for conserved secondary structures and for assigning confidence values to the predicted base pairs.Availability: The C++ source code that implements the {McCaskill}-{MEA} algorithm and the test dataset used in this paper are available at Contact:kiryu-h@aist.go.{jpSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It is based on a set of empirical free energy change parameters derived from experiments using a nearest-neighbor model. In this study, a program, {MaxExpect}, that predicts {RNA} secondary structure by maximizing the expected base-pair accuracy, is reported. This approach was first pioneered in the program {CONTRAfold}, using pair probabilities predicted with a statistical learning method. Here, a partition function calculation that utilizes the free energy change nearest-neighbor parameters is used to predict base-pair probabilities as well as probabilities of nucleotides being single-stranded. {MaxExpect} predicts both the optimal structure (having highest expected pair accuracy) and suboptimal structures to serve as alternative hypotheses for the structure. Tested on a large database of different types of {RNA}, the maximum expected accuracy structures are, on average, of higher accuracy than minimum free energy structures. Accuracy is measured by sensitivity, the percentage of known base pairs correctly predicted, and positive predictive value ({PPV}), the percentage of predicted pairs that are in the known structure. By favoring double-strandedness or single-strandedness, a higher sensitivity or {PPV} of prediction can be favored, respectively. Using {MaxExpect}, the average {PPV} of optimal structure is improved from 66\% to 68\% at the same sensitivity level (73\%) compared with free energy minimization.},

Thus, the development of additional algorithms to detect conformational switches seems important, especially since the difference in free energy between the two metastable secondary structures may be as large as 15-20 kcal/mol.

However, there is room for improvement in the objective functions presented in previous studies, which are maximized in the posterior decoding with respect to the accuracy measures for secondary structures.Results: We propose novel estimators which improve the accuracy of secondary structure prediction of {RNAs}. The proposed estimators maximize an objective function which is the weighted sum of the expected number of the true positives and that of the true negatives of the base pairs. The proposed estimators are also improved versions of the ones used in previous works, namely {CONTRAfold} for secondary structure prediction from a single {RNA} sequence and {McCaskill}-{MEA} for common secondary structure prediction from multiple alignments of {RNA} sequences. We clarify the relations between the proposed estimators and the estimators presented in previous works, and theoretically show that the previous estimators include additional unnecessary terms in the evaluation measures with respect to the accuracy. Furthermore, computational experiments confirm the theoretical analysis by indicating improvement in the empirical accuracy.

Training the model with thermodynamic regularization ensures that folding scores and the calculated free energy are as close as possible. In computational experiments designed for newly discovered non-coding {RNAs}, our algorithm ({MXfold}2) achieves the most robust and accurate predictions of {RNA} secondary structures without sacrificing computational efficiency compared to several other algorithms.

Secondary structure can be predicted successfully from experimental thermodynamic data on secondary structure elements: helices, loops, and bulges. Tertiary interactions can then be added without much distortion of the secondary structure. These observations suggest a folding algorithm to predict the structure of an {RNA} from its sequence. However, to solve the {RNA} folding problem one needs thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions, and identification and characterization of metal-ion binding sites.

	abstract = {{RNA} prediction has long been struggling with long-range base pairs since prediction accuracy decreases with base pair span. We analyze here the empirical distribution of base pair spans in large collection of experimentally known {RNA} structures. Surprisingly, we find that long-range base pairs are overrepresented in these data. In particular, there is no evidence that long-range base pairs are systematically overpredicted relative to short-range interactions in thermodynamic predictions. This casts doubt on a recent suggestion that kinetic effects are the cause of length-dependent decrease of predictability. Instead of a modification of the energy model we advocate a modification of the expected accuracy model for {RNA} secondary structures. We demonstrate that the inclusion of a span-dependent penalty leads to improved maximum expected accuracy structure predictions compared to both the standard {MEA} model and a modified folding algorithm with an energy penalty function. The prevalence of long-range base pairs provide further evidence that {RNA} structures in general do not have the so-called polymer zeta property. This has consequences for the asymptotic performance for a large class of sparsified {RNA} folding algorithms.},

	abstract = {Structured {RNAs} achieve their active states by traversing complex, multidimensional energetic landscapes. Here we probe the folding landscape of the Tetrahymena ribozyme by using a powerful approach: the folding of single ribozyme molecules is followed beginning from distinct regions of the folding landscape. The experiments, combined with small-angle x-ray scattering results, show that the landscape contains discrete folding pathways. These pathways are separated by large free-energy barriers that prevent interconversion between them, indicating that the pathways lie in deep channels in the folding landscape. Chemical protection and mutagenesis experiments are then used to elucidate the structural features that determine which folding pathway is followed. Strikingly, a specific long-range tertiary contact can either help folding or hinder folding, depending on when it is formed during the process. Together these results provide an unprecedented view of the topology of an {RNA} folding landscape and the {RNA} structural features that underlie this multidimensional landscape.},

	abstract = {Repressors, polymerases, ribosomes and other macromolecules bind to specific nucleic acid sequences. They can find a binding site only if the sequence has a recognizable pattern. We define a measure of the information (Rsequence) in the sequence patterns at binding sites. It allows one to investigate how information is distributed across the sites and to compare one site to another. One can also calculate the amount of information (Rfrequency) that would be required to locate the sites, given that they occur with some frequency in the genome. Several Escherichia coli binding sites were analyzed using these two independent empirical measurements. The two amounts of information are similar for most of the sites we analyzed. In contrast, bacteriophage T7 {RNA} polymerase binding sites contain about twice as much information as is necessary for recognition by the T7 polymerase, suggesting that a second protein may bind at T7 promoters. The extra information can be accounted for by a strong symmetry element found at the T7 promoters. This element may be an operator. If this model is correct, these promoters and operators do not share much information. The comparisons between Rsequence and Rfrequency suggest that the information at binding sites is just sufficient for the sites to be distinguished from the rest of the genome.},

There is now strong evidence indicating that an {RNA} World did indeed exist before {DNA}- and protein-based life. However, arguments regarding whether life on Earth began with {RNA} are more tenuous. It might be imagined that all of the components of {RNA} were available in some prebiotic pool, and that these components assembled into replicating, evolving polynucleotides without the prior existence of any evolved macromolecules. A thorough consideration of this “{RNA}-first” view of the origin of life must reconcile concerns regarding the intractable mixtures that are obtained in experiments designed to simulate the chemistry of the primitive Earth. Perhaps these concerns will eventually be resolved, and recent experimental findings provide some reason for optimism. However, the problem of the origin of the {RNA} World is far from being solved, and it is fruitful to consider the alternative possibility that {RNA} was preceded by some other replicating, evolving molecule, just as {DNA} and proteins were preceded by {RNA}., {RNA} probably preceded {DNA} as the genetic material. {RNA} in this “{RNA} world” may have arisen by prebiotic catalysis or from an earlier “{RNA}-like world” based on p-{RNA} or {PNA}.},

	abstract = {{RNA}-directed recombination can be used to catalyze a disproportionation reaction among small {RNA} substrates to create new combinations of sequences. But the accommodation of secondary and tertiary structural constraints in the substrates by recombinase ribozymes has not been explored. Here, we show that the Azoarcus group I intron can recombine oligoribonucleotides to construct class I ligase ribozymes, which are catalytically active upon synthesis. The substrate oligonucleotides, ranging in size from 58 to 104 nucleotides (nt), along with the 152-nt ligase ribozymes they reconstitute, can contain significant amounts of secondary structure. However, substrate recognition by the Azoarcus ribozyme depends on the existence of a single accessible {CAU} triplet for effective recombination. A biphasic temperature reaction profile was designed such that the sequential recombination/ligation events could take place in a thermocycler without human intervention. A temperature-dependent {pH} shift of the reaction buffer contributes to the success of the net reaction. When the substrate for the ligase ribozyme is introduced into the reaction mixture, as much as 11\% can be observed being converted to product by the recombined ligase in the same reaction vessel. Recombination followed by ligation can also occur under isothermal conditions at 37 degrees C. Tertiary structure formation of the ligase upon construction can provide some protection from cleavage by the Azoarcus ribozyme when compared to the constituent substrates. These data suggest that {RNA}-directed recombination can, in fact, articulate complex ribozymes, and that there are logical rules that can guide the optimal placement of the {CAU} recognition sequence.},

It is natural to ask how pure and minimal this fundamental quantum description can be. The simplest quantum ontology is that of the Everett or Many-Worlds interpretation, based on a vector in Hilbert space and a Hamiltonian. Typically one also relies on some classical structure, such as space and local configuration variables within it, which then gets promoted to an algebra of preferred observables. We argue that even such an algebra is unnecessary, and the most basic description of the world is given by the spectrum of the Hamiltonian (a list of energy eigenvalues) and the components of some particular vector in Hilbert space. Everything else - including space and fields propagating on it - is emergent from these minimal elements.},

A counterintuitive feature of photosynthesis is that the primary pigments involved in absorbing light—for example, chlorophyll a and b in plants—do not all absorb right at the peak of the spectrum but instead are offset from the peak and each other. Arp et al. formulated a network model that explains how using pigments with this absorption-peak pattern can mitigate internal and external fluctuations in energy transfer, minimizing noise in output power (see the Perspective by Duffy). The model accurately reproduces absorption peaks for three diverse photosynthetic systems from different spectral environments. Such a mechanism may provide an underlying robustness to biological photosynthetic processes that can be further tuned and tweaked to adapt to longer-scale fluctuations in light intensity.
Science, this issue p. 1490; see also p. 1427
Photosynthesis achieves near unity light-harvesting quantum efficiency yet it remains unknown whether there exists a fundamental organizing principle giving rise to robust light harvesting in the presence of dynamic light conditions and noisy physiological environments. Here, we present a noise-canceling network model that relates noisy physiological conditions, power conversion efficiency, and the resulting absorption spectra of photosynthetic organisms. Using light conditions in full solar exposure, light filtered by oxygenic phototrophs, and light filtered under seawater, we derived optimal absorption characteristics for efficient solar power conversion. We show how light-harvesting antennae can be tuned to maximize power conversion efficiency by minimizing excitation noise, thus providing a unified theoretical basis for the observed wavelength dependence of absorption in green plants, purple bacteria, and green sulfur bacteria.
Optimally spaced pairs of off-center absorption peaks can maximize photosynthetic output in the face of external noise.

The magnitude and directions of the dipole moments of the adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine base groups have been calculated by a semi-empirical molecular orbital treatment. Dipole—dipole, dipole—induced-dipole and London force interactions among the bases in the helix are large, and make the free energy of the helix depend on the base composition and sequence. The helix stability (helix negative free energy) is proportional to the guanine + cytosine content. A comparison of calculated base-pair interactions with the nearest-neighbor base frequency data of Josse, Kaiser \& Kornberg (1961) suggests that the base sequence in natural {DNA} may be influenced by the free energy. The free energy of the coil is difficult to estimate ; it tends to be more negative from base—solvent interactions for a greater guanine—cytosine content. The choice of solvent determines the magnitude of these interactions and thus determines how the melting temperature of the helix will depend on the base composition. In a solvent such as water, in which significant base—base interactions exist in the coil, the coil free energy depends on the base sequence and London forces may cause stacking of the bases into ordered arrays. The hydrogen bond energy of the bases and the strain energy in the helix probably contribute little to the enthalpy change of the helix—coil transition, although they ensure specific base-pairing in the helix. The net contribution of configurational and solvent entropy changes to the free energy change of the helix—coil transition is also probably small.},

Many important {RNA} molecules, however, contain pseudo-knots, a structural feature that is excluded explicitly from the conventional definition of secondary structures. We propose here a generalization of secondary structures incorporating ‘non-nested’ pseudo-knots, which we call bi-secondary structures, and discuss measures for the complexity of more general contact structures based on their graph-theoretical properties. Bi-secondary structures are planar trivalent graphs that are characterized by special embedding properties. We derive exact upper bounds on their number (as a function of the chain length n) implying that there are fewer different structures than sequences. Computational results show that the number of bi-secondary structures grows approximately like 2.35n. Numerical studies based on kinetic folding and a simple extension of the standard energy model show that the global features of the sequence-structure map of {RNA} do not change when pseudo-knots are introduced into the secondary structure picture. We find a large fraction of neutral mutations and, in particular, networks of sequences that fold into the same shape. These neutral networks percolate through the entire sequence space.},

	abstract = {{RNA} pseudoknots have important functions, and thermodynamic stability is a key to predicting pseudoknots in {RNA} sequences and to understanding their functions. Traditional methods, such as {UV} melting and differential scanning calorimetry, for measuring {RNA} thermodynamics are restricted to temperature ranges around the melting temperature for a pseudoknot. Here, we report {RNA} pseudoknot free energy changes at 37 °C measured by fluorescence competition assays. Sequence-dependent studies for the loop 1−stem 2 region reveal (1) the individual nearest-neighbor hydrogen bonding ({INN}-{HB}) model provides a reasonable estimate for the free energy change when a Watson−Crick base pair in stem 2 is changed, (2) the loop entropy can be estimated by a statistical polymer model, although some penalty for certain loop sequences is necessary, and (3) tertiary interactions can significantly stabilize pseudoknots and extending the length of stem 2 may alter tertiary interactions such that the {INN}-{HB} model does not predict the net effect of adding a base pair. The results can inform writing of algorithms for predicting and/or designing {RNA} secondary structures.},

Computational prediction of {RNA} secondary structure is among          the few structure prediction problems that can be solved satisfactorily in polynomial time. Most work has been done to predict structures that do not contain pseudoknots. Allowing pseudoknots introduces          modeling and computational problems. In this paper we consider the problem of predicting {RNA} secondary structures with pseudoknots based on free energy minimization. We first give a brief comparison of          energy-based methods for predicting {RNA} secondary structures with pseudoknots. We then prove that the general problem of predicting {RNA} secondary structures containing pseudoknots is {NP} complete for a large          class of reasonable models of pseudoknots.},

The thermodynamics of such {RNA}–{RNA} interactions can be understood as the sum of two energy contributions: (1) the energy necessary to ‘open’ the binding site and (2) the energy gained from hybridization.Methods: We present an extension of the standard partition function approach to {RNA} secondary structures that computes the probabilities Pu[i, j] that a sequence interval [i, j] is unpaired.Results: Comparison with experimental data shows that Pu[i, j] can be applied as a significant determinant of local target site accessibility for {RNA} interference ({RNAi}). Furthermore, these quantities can be used to rigorously determine binding free energies of short oligomers to large {mRNA} targets. The resource consumption is comparable with a single partition function computation for the large target molecule. We can show that {RNAi} efficiency correlates well with the binding energies of {siRNAs} to their respective {mRNA} target.Availability:{RNAup} will be distributed as part of the Vienna {RNA} Package, Contact:ivo@tbi.univie.ac.at},

	abstract = {{RNAs} sind sehr wichtige Biomoleküle. Früher sah man in ihnen nur die Zwischenstufe zwischen {DNA}, dem Träger der genetischen Information, und Proteinen, den Katalysatoren biochemischer Reaktionen. Heute wissen wir von der Existenz verschiedenster Klassen von {RNAs}, die selbst katalytische Eigenschaften haben. Die Funktion eines {RNA}-Moleküls ist von seiner dreidimensionalen Struktur (der Tertiärstruktur) abhängig, die wiederum von den Basenpaarung innerhalb des {RNA}-Moleküls (der Sekundärstruktur) abhängig ist.

Um von der linearen Sequenz (der Primärstruktur) auf die Funktion eines {RNA}-Moleküls schließen zu können, sollte man im Idealfall in der Lage sein, allein von der Sequenz die komplette dreidimensionale Struktur vorhersagen zu können. Weil aber {RNA}-Faltung als hierarchischer Prozess betrachtet werden kann, wobei sich die Sekundärstruktur vor jeglichen tertiären Interaktionen ausbildet, kann schon die Sekundärstruktur als Ausgangspunkt für die funktionelle Analyse dienen. Dementsprechend ist {RNA}-Sekundärstrukturvorhersage ein zentrales Problem der Bioinformatik.

Der Großteil aller {RNA}-Basenpaare ist perfekt verschachtelt, was bedeutet, daß alle Nukleotide, die von einem Basenpaar umschlossen sind, nicht mit Nukleotiden außerhalb dieses Basenpaars interagieren. Diese Eigenschaft erlaubt es, die gesamte {RNA} Sekundärstruktur in einfachere und voneinander unabhängige Substrukturen, die sogenannten Loops, für deren freie Energien man Parameter kennt, zu zerlegen. Dynamic Programming, der am häufigsten verwendete Ansatz zur {RNA}-Sekundärstrukturvorhersage, ist auf diese Loop-Zerlegung angewiesen. 

Pseudoknoten, von denen man in letzter Zeit immer mehr entdeckt hat, sind {RNA}-Strukturen, die diesen vereinfachenden Schritt nicht zulassen. Bei einem Pseudoknoten formen Nukleotide innerhalb eines Loops Basenpaare mit Nukleotiden außerhalb des Loops und verletzen damit die Bedingung der perfekt verschachtelten Sekundärstrukturen. Deshalb ist die Berücksichtigung von Pseudoknoten rechnerisch komplizierter und aufwändiger und herkömmliche Algorithmen zur {RNA}-Sekundärstrukturvorhersage schließen Pseudoknoten der Einfachkeit halber aus.

Erst in den letzten Jahren wurden Ansätze zur Vorhersage von Pseudoknoten entwickelt, die entweder auf Dynamic Programming oder auf heuristischen Methoden beruhen. In dieser Diplomarbeit präsentiere ich {PKplex}, einen neuen, Dynamic Programming-basierten Algorithmus zur Vorhersage von {RNA} Sekundärstrukturen mit Pseudoknoten. Zuerst wird die grundlegende Idee hinter {PKplex} und ihre Umsetzung beschrieben, und dann wird der Algorithmus auf einen großen Datensatz bekannter {RNA} Pseudoknoten angewandt und seine Ergebnisse mit denen anderer publizierter Algorithmen verglichen.},

It is insufficient to give detailed insights into the dynamic behavior of {RNAs}.

Results: We introduce the Basin Hopping Graph ({BHG}) as a novel coarse-grained model of folding landscapes. Each vertex of the {BHG} is a local minimum, which represents the corresponding basin in the landscape. Its edges connect basins when the direct transitions between them are ‘energetically favorable’. Edge weights endcode the corresponding saddle heights and thus measure the difficulties of these favorable transitions. {BHGs} can be approximated accurately and efficiently for {RNA} molecules well beyond the length range accessible to enumerative algorithms.

These gradients, when steep enough, give rise to far from equilibrium dissipative structures (e.g., galaxies, stars, black holes, hurricanes and life) which emerge spontaneously to hasten the destruction of the gradients which spawned them.

Although preformed oligonucleotides have been shown to facilitate the formation of their complements from activated mononucleotides, only a restricted range of oligomers are efficient templates1 and it will clearly be difficult to find a pair of complementary oligomers each of which will facilitate the formation of the other2. Many of the difficulties facing the development of a self-replicating system could be overcome by using a pair of complementary substrate molecules that condense together more easily than ribonucleotides. It would also be helpful if each substrate molecule contained equal numbers of purine and pyrimidine bases as, otherwise, there is a tendency for purines to be over-represented in the products1. We have therefore explored the chemistry of 3'-amino-3'-deoxynucleotides3 and their dimers4. We report here that the tetranucleoside triphosphoramidate {GNHpCNHpGNHpCN}3 acts as a template to catalyse the condensation of {GNHpCNH}2 and {pGNHpCN}3, forming further molecules of the template. The system is therefore autocatalytic, and in accordance with elementary theory the amount of product made increases with the square root of the template concentration.},

	abstract = {{THE} development of non-enzymatic self-replicating systems based on autocatalytic template-directed reactions is a current objective of bioorganic chemistry1–6. Typically, a self-complementary template molecule {AB} is synthesized autocatalytically from two complementary template fragments A and B7–16. Natural replication of nucleic acids, however, utilizes complementary rather than self-complementary strands. Here we report on a minimal implementation of this type of replication17 based on cross-catalytic template-directed syntheses of hexadeoxy nucleotide derivatives from amino-trideoxynucleotides. In our experiments, two self-complementary and two complementary templates compete for their combinatorial synthesis from four common trimeric precursors. We provide kinetic evidence that cross-catalytic self-replication of complementary templates can proceed with an efficiency similar to that of autocatalytic self-replication of self-complementary templates. We observe selective stimulation of template synthesis, and thus information transfer, on seeding the reaction mixtures with one of four chemically labelled templates bearing the sequence of the reaction products. Our results bring a stage closer the development of schemes that might explain how replicating systems based on nucleic acids arose on the prebiotic Earth.},

The de novo design of such devices using computational methods and prediction tools is a resource-efficient alternative to experimental screening and selection pipelines. In this review, we describe methods common to many such computational approaches, thoroughly dissect these methods and highlight open questions for the individual steps. Initially, it is essential to investigate the biological target system, the regulatory mechanism that will be exploited, as well as the desired components in order to define design objectives. Subsequent computational design is needed to combine the selected components and to obtain novel functionality. This process can usually be split into constrained sequence sampling, the formulation of an optimization problem and an in silico analysis to narrow down the number of candidates with respect to secondary goals. Finally, experimental analysis is important to check whether the defined design objectives are indeed met in the target environment and detailed characterization experiments should be performed to improve the mechanistic models and detect missing design requirements.},

Higher abstraction levels based on a macro-state decomposition of the landscape enable the study of larger systems; however, they are still restricted by huge memory requirements of exact approaches. Results: We present a highly parallelizable local enumeration scheme that enables the computation of exact macro-state transition models with highly reduced memory requirements. The approach is evaluated on {RNA} secondary structure landscapes using a gradient basin definition for macro-states. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for exact transition models by comparing two barrier-based approaches, and perform a detailed investigation of gradient basins in {RNA} energy landscapes.

Ribozyme and metabolite-controlled, aptazyme-regulated expression devices with quantitatively predictable functions were assembled from components characterized in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. The models and design strategy were verified by constructing 28 Escherichia coli expression devices that gave excellent quantitative agreement between the predicted and measured gene expression levels (r = 0.94). These technologies were applied to engineer {RNA}-regulated controls in metabolic pathways. More broadly, we provide a framework for studying {RNA} functions and illustrate the potential for the use of biochemical and biophysical modeling to develop biological design methods.

The idea that selection operates on nonreproducing, higher-level systems including ecosystems or societies, has met with scepticism. But research emphasising that natural selection can be based solely on differential persistence invites reconsideration of their evolution. Self-perpetuating feedback cycles involving biotic as well as abiotic components are critical to determining persistence. Evolution of autocatalytic networks of molecules is well studied, but the principles hold for any ‘self-perpetuating’ system. Ecosystem examples include coral reefs, rainforests, and savannahs. Societal examples include agricultural systems, dominant belief systems, and economies. Persistence-based selection of feedbacks can help us understand how ecological and societal systems survive or fail in a changing world.},

Here, we derive, from basic principles, general stoichiometric conditions for catalysis and autocatalysis in chemical reaction networks. This allows for a classification of minimal autocatalytic motifs called cores. While all known autocatalytic systems indeed contain minimal motifs, the classification also reveals hitherto unidentified motifs. We further examine conditions for kinetic viability of such networks, which depends on the autocatalytic motifs they contain and is notably increased by internal catalytic cycles. Finally, we show how this framework extends the range of conceivable autocatalytic systems, by applying our stoichiometric and kinetic analysis to autocatalysis emerging from coupled compartments. The unified approach to autocatalysis presented in this work lays a foundation toward the building of a systems-level theory of chemical evolution.},

	title = {Deﬁning Autocatalysis in Chemical Reaction Networks},
	abstract = {Autocatalysis is a deceptively simple concept, referring to the situation that a chemical species X catalyzes its own formation. From the perspective of chemical kinetics, autocatalysts show a regime of super-linear growth. Given a chemical reaction network, however, it is not at all straightforward to identify species that are autocatalytic in the sense that there is a sub-network that takes X as input and produces more than one copy of X as output. The diﬃculty arises from the need to distinguish autocatalysis e.g. from the superposition of a cycle that consumes and produces equal amounts of X and a pathway that produces X. To deal with this issue, a number of competing notions, such as exclusive autocatalysis and autocatalytic cycles, have been introduced. A closer inspection of concepts and their usage by diﬀerent authors shows, however, that subtle diﬀerences in the deﬁnitions often makes conceptually matching ideas diﬃcult to bring together formally. In this contribution we make some of the available approaches comparable by translating them into a common formal framework that uses integer hyperﬂows as a basis to study autocatalysis in large chemical reaction networks. As an application we investigate the prevalence of autocatalysis in metabolic networks.},

	abstract = {Secondary structure formation is an important factor influencing the behaviour of many types of naturally occurring {RNA} molecules. {RNA} secondary structure also provides an example of a disordered system showing frustration and a rugged energy landscape with many alternative ground states. We use a numerical method to estimate energy barrier heights between a set of alternative ground-state structures of a given sequence. Both the mean barrier height and the maximum barrier height for a given sequence scale with a sequence length N approximately as . The matrix h of barriers is exactly ultrametric, which means that structures form an exactly hierarchical set of clusters based on barrier heights. The matrix of distances d between structures is correlated with h, but with large fluctuations. Hence, the d matrix is approximately ultrametric, but the clustering of structures based on distances is not perfectly hierarchical. Certain base pairs are observed to be present in every ground-state structure. These `frozen' pairs divide the molecule up into mutually inaccessible pieces. All of the separate pieces contribute to determining the distance between structures, but only the largest piece will contribute to the barrier height. The length of the largest piece varies between sequences, and scales in proportion to N on average. We compare these results with studies of other disordered systems, and discuss the consequences for the folding of naturally occurring {RNAs}.},

	abstract = {{RNA} secondary structure prediction is widely used to understand {RNA} function. Recently, there has been a shift away from the classical minimum free energy methods to partition function-based methods that account for folding ensembles and can therefore estimate structure and base pair probabilities. However, the classical partition function algorithm scales cubically with sequence length, and is therefore prohibitively slow for long sequences. This slowness is even more severe than cubic-time free energy minimization due to a substantially larger constant factor in runtime.Inspired by the success of our recent {LinearFold} algorithm that predicts the approximate minimum free energy structure in linear time, we design a similar linear-time heuristic algorithm, {LinearPartition}, to approximate the partition function and base-pairing probabilities, which is shown to be orders of magnitude faster than Vienna {RNAfold} and {CONTRAfold} (e.g. 2.5 days versus 1.3 min on a sequence with length 32 753 nt). More interestingly, the resulting base-pairing probabilities are even better correlated with the ground-truth structures. {LinearPartition} also leads to a small accuracy improvement when used for downstream structure prediction on families with the longest length sequences (16S and 23S {rRNAs}), as well as a substantial improvement on long-distance base pairs (500+ nt apart).Code: http://github.com/{LinearFold}/{LinearPartition}; Server: http://linearfold.org/partition.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
