This thesis presents our contributions to RNA secondary structures' computational methods for the folding and inverse folding problems. They were obtained in collaboration with my advisor Matteo Smerlak, Vaitea Opuu and Vincent Messow. Most of the ideas and figures have appeared previously in the following publications:

In addition to these works in RNA folding and inverse folding, I studied the fragility of RNA viruses during my PhD using multi-agent evolutionary algorithm simulations. I also contributed to various works in natural language processing and multi-agent simulations for Holonification models. 
None of these investigations,
