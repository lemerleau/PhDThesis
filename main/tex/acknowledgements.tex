\section*{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:acknowledgements}

I am grateful to everyone who took part in my journey writing a master's thesis in the middle of a pandemic.

I would like to thank Peter Stadler for his straightforward and approachable supervision.
I am particularly thankful for the guidance and opportunities to learn beyond the scope of my thesis that Matteo Smerlak provided.

Furthermore, I would like to express my appreciation for everyone in the workgroup \emph{Structure of Evolution}, especially Nono Saha Cyrille Merleau and Vaitea Opuu for their valuable feedback and comments.
I felt very welcome and valued.
I would also like to extend my thanks to the staff at MPI MiS for competent organisational assistance throughout the pandemic.
I wish to acknowledge Camille Lambert from \emph{Laboratoire de Biochimie} at ESPCI Paris in France for working on \textit{in vitro} experiments and generously providing preliminary results.

Finally, I cannot stress enough how thankful I am for the support from my family and friends --- in particular from my parents for their trust, Franzi for her help in restructuring my first draft and Moritz for proofreading.
